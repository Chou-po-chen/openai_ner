(TO: UT;MR/vo 11.8.63) \nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr U Perich):\nSections show an acinar adenocarcinoma with the following features:\nHistological type:  Acinar adenocarcinoma\nTumour location:\nDominant nodule:  Left apex, left mid and left base prostate, in both anterior and posterior halves, with contiguous extension into right anterior mid and right anterior base prostate.\n\tNon-dominant (>10mm):  Nil\n\tSmaller nodules: Nil\nVolume/Size: 4ml (28mm x 13 mm x 27.2mm x 0.0004)(Blinn's method)\nGleason score:  N/A\nCOMMENT\nAlthough the Gleason score appears 3+5=8 with tertiary pattern 4, Gleason grading post androgen deprivation therapy is not recommended as treatment may result in tumour morphology with spurious and misleading higher grade appearances and may not be predictive of prognosis.\nExtraprostatic extension:  Present; extensive (Wheeler's defintition) \n-  Left base anterior and posterior, up to 3mm beyond the prostate over a front of 11.5mm with associated extraprostatic perineural invasion (A19), also lesser foci left base anterior (A16, A18)\n-  Left mid posterolateral up to 3mm beyond the prostate over a front of 9mm (A22, A23)\n-  Left mid lateral, up to 0.5mm over a front of 0.5mm (A25L2), lesser foci left mid lateral (A24)\nSurgical margins:  Positive\nThe carcinoma extends to the anterior margin across a front of 0.3mm (A25L3) in the anterior mid prostate, inferiorly.  At this location the advancing edge shows dispersed, often single cell infiltration and it is very difficult to distinguish tumour cells from background inflammatory cells, due to lack of typical carcinoma morphology (cytoplasmic clearing, nuclear pyknosis and loss of nucleoli) related to androgen deprivation therapy.  However a keratin immunostain (AE1/AE3) highlights single cells at the inked margin (ink on tumour cells) and the margin is best regarded as positive.  The P540S immunoperoxidase stains is also positive in single cells here, but there may be some background staining of non-neoplastic cells.  Multiple levels have been reviewed.  Elsewhere, including at the base in the area of extraprostatic extension, the margins are clear.\nShown to Dr U Leitzel who concurs.\nPerineural invasion:  Present extensive\nSeminal vesicles:  Involved \nThe muscular walls of both the right (A12) and left (A19) seminalvesicles are invaded by acinar adenocarcinoma \nLymph nodes:  Six negative lymph nodes (0/6) \n(Three (3) negative right pelvic lymph; three (3) negative left pelvic lymph nodes) (\nLymphovascular invasion:  Not seen \nStage N(AJCC/UICC TNM system, 7th edition):\npT3b  Seminal vesicle invasion \npN0  No positive regional nodes. \nMX  Cannot be assessed histologically\nR1  Microscopic residual tumour\nOther:\nThe non-involved acini show patchy atrophy and basal cell hyperplasia.

Sections of solardamaged skin show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma showing focal keratinisation.  The tumour invades into deep subcutis to a depth of approximately 4mm.  \nCarcinoma extends to 0.5mm of the deep margin and within 0.5mmof the 3 o'clock margin.   The carcinoma appears well clear of the 9 o'clock, 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock margins.  \nA focus of perineural invasion is identified at the deep aspect of the tumour.  This focus is best seen in the CAM 5.2 stain where it is approximately 1mm from the deep margin.  \nImmunohistochemistry:\nThe tumour cells show positive staining with CAM 5.2 but are negative for melanoma markers HMB45, Melan A and S100.  \nThe S100 stain shows patchy staining.  The majority of tumour cells appear to be negative and it is possible that the staining is of dendritic cells in the background particularly given the negative result for HMB45 and Melan A.  \nB.  Sections show a fragment of fibroadipose tissue with attached skeletal muscle.  No epidermis is present in thesections.  There is a circumscribed nodule composed of highly atypical, large epithelioid cells with prominent nucleoli.  No pigment is identified within these cells.  There is an infiltrate of lymphocytes at the periphery of this nodule raising the possibility that this may represent a lymph node metastases.  Lymphovascular invasion is also identified in the immediately adjacent connective tissue.  \nThe tumour cells show strong positive staining for HMB45, Melan A and S100 but are negative for CAM 5.2.  The morphological and immunohistochemical findings would be consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.  The lines of excision appear clear of the tumour by a distance of 0.1mm superficially.  The other margins appear well clear.  \nC.  The sections of solar damaged skin show no evidence of malignancy.  There is a small focus of chronic inflammation and fat necrosis in the subcutis, possibly relating to previous biopsy of surgery.  A seborrhoeic keratosis is noted on the skin surface as well as an area of actinic keratosis.  \nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

The specimen includes attached gallbladder 95mm x 45mm, greater omentum 80 x 30 x 15mm and lesser omentum 25 x 25 x 10mm. There are two separate pieces of presumed greater omental tissue 360 and 80mm in maximum dimension with an area of grey discolouration 40 x 35 x 10mm identified on one surface. The margins are inked as follows: pancreatic neck resection margin black,  periuncinate soft tissue (SMA) resection margin green, the portal vein bed resection margin blue (including the portal vein wall identified by Dr Fechtner),  posterior retroperitoneal margin orange, anterior pancreatic surface purple and the inferior pancreaticsurface yellow.\n The cut surface reveals an ill-defined grey area (? tumour) with loss of lobular architecture in the anterior superior head of pancreas measuring approximately 25 x 22 x 12mm.  There is a firm yellow area within the adjacent fat (? fat necrosis ? tumour extension) measuring 12 x 12 x 8mm.  The pancreatic duct is not identified.   The common bile duct is patent via a stent which extends its full length to the opening at the ampulla of Vater, the latter with an unremarkable mucosal surface. The mucosa of the duodenum and stomach is unremarkable. The serosa of the gallbladder appears mildly haemorrhagic.  The maximum thickness of the wall is 3mm.  No gallstones are identified.  One large lymph node 15mm is identified in the attached greater omental fat and multiple small lymph nodes are identified around the common bile duct margin.  \nBlock 1 - common bile duct margin; 2 - bowel and stomach resection margins; 3-9 - TS of pancreas to small bowel; 10-14 - full face of pancreas from inferior to superior; 15-20 - TS superior end of pancreas (paired blocks 16/17, 18/19); 21 & 22 - large greater omentum lymph node; 23 - lymph nodes around common bile duct; 24 - ? lesser omentum lymph nodes; 25 - ? greater omentum lymph node; 26 -representative gallbladder; 27-30 - representative greater omentum. Please refer to attached diagram.  (TO: CV;CT/ec 2.8.62) \n MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr S Matro) \nSections show a moderately to poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma centred within pancreatic head.  The tumour is predominantly  composed of small to large round to angulated glands with moderate to focally marked nuclear pleomorphism, occasionally  prominent nucleoli, eosinophilic cytoplasm, foci of goblet cell differentiation and patchy intraluminalnecrosis.  There are also numerous foci of single cell infiltration. \nExtent\nThe tumour has an infiltrative margin and focally extends into the wall of the stented intrapancreatic common bile duct, infiltrates around the pancreatic duct and extensively infiltrates the wall of the duodenum reachingnon-ulcerated mucosa.  The tumour invades fibrous tissue in proximity to the portal vein wall but no mural smooth muscle invasion is seen. There is also extrapancreatic invasion into adipose tissue posteriorly (perineural spread) and into adipose tissue between the duodenal wall and pancreas superiorly (contiguous invasion and perineural spread).  Extensiveperineural invasion is present both within the confines of tumour and as outlying foci.  A focus of mural vascular invasion is present and foci suspicious for lymphovascular invasion present, including within the duodenal wall.  Retractionartefact around tumour does make assessment of lymphovascular invasion difficult. \nTumour response to therapy:\nAlthough there is some fibrosis around tumour, there is extensive residual tumour and no significant tumour necrosis.  The tumour regression grade is therefore 3 (poor response).\nMargins\nThe pancreatic neck margin is 0.2mm from tumour, the portal vein margin <0.1mm from tumour (with perineural invasion 0.2mm from this margin) while the portal vein wall resection margins is at least 0.5mm from tumour (some sectioning disruption of this margin limits assessment). The periuncinate margin is >5.5mm clear and the posterior retroperitoneal surface is 4mm clear.  The extrahepatic common bile duct, duodenal and gastric margins are all well clear.\n \nOther pathology\nThe pancreas shows associated changes of chronic pancreatitis with ductolobular atrophy, fibrosis and chronic inflammation.  Away from the tumour there is mucinous and goblet cell metaplasia of ductules and focal mucinous metaplasia with micropapillae formation in a larger duct (PanIN/L 1B).  Changes consistent with previous surgery are present with suture/foreign body granulomas with the greater omentum and serosa of stomach plus chronic inflammation and fat necrosis with admixed giant cells within the peripancreatic fat.  The area of grey discolouration described in the greater omentum comprises fibrosis and suture granulomas.  Within adipose tissue posterior to the pancreas, there is also an abscess containing filamentous material suggestive of Actinomyces organisms.

(20G60877 - Leiomyosarcoma, FNCLCC grade 1 on core biopsy of soft tissue mass over left elbow in subcutaneous plane, present for five years.Recently growing.)\nMACROSCOPIC:\nA.   Specimen labelled \"Sarcoma left elbow, suture at 12 o'clock\"consists of an orientated soft tissue mass, 100 x 120 x 40 mm.    There is an ellipse of skin, 44 x 120 mm with a suture denoting 12 o'clock identifies one apex of the ellipse.   There is a central swellingdeep to the ellipse and extending into the underlying subcutaneous tissue in a multinodular lobated fashion.   There is focally very thin normal subcutaneous fat at the superficial margin and at the deep margin there is a thin layer of loose fibrous type tissue, consistent with tissue spanning a tissue plane of the fascia.    The lateral superficial margin inked blue, medial green and deep black.    Sectioning reveals a pale grey multinodular tumour which is mostly solid but also shows central cystic degeneration with myxoid material.   It appears to be circumscribed and measures 70 x 90 x 28mm.   Tumour reaches very close to the deep, medial superficial and lateral superficial margins (less than 1 mm).    The superior and inferior soft tissue margins appear clear (greater than 10 mm each).    \nBlocks 1 to 8 - rep sections of tumour from superior towards inferior showing margins as inked; 9 - LS 12 o'clock margin;10 - LS 6 o'clock margin.\nB.

The tumour is a subcutaneous leiomyosarcoma which appears of a higher grade than that reported on the core biopsy (see 20G60877).  There are focal areas of necrosis but well below 50% (score 1).  The mitotic rate is focally very high particularly at the advancing edge and in these areas the count exceeds 20/10 HPF (score 3).  The tumour is therefore of grade 3 - total score 6 (tumour differentiation -2, mitoses count -3, tumour necrosis - 1).  \nThe tumour is well circumscribed but with outlying nodules, and the sarcoma extends to, but does not infiltrate dermis.  The surgical margins appear close but clear superficially and deep.  The deep and superficial margins are 0.5mm clear in focal areas.  No venous or perineural invasion is identified.  The superior and inferior margins are well clear.  \nB.  Sections show skin and minimal subcutaneous fat.  There is no tumour present.  \nDIAGNOSIS:\nA,B.

The CAM 5.2 keratin immunostains are negative. \nB.  The specimen has been entirely blocked. Two clips are present within the post-operative specimen radiographs. These were not identified at the time of gross dissection,however, a single clip is present within a radiograph of the specimen blocks (block 18).  The second clip has presumably been displaced during processing.  In the vicinity of the clip there is an area of mild fibrosis, chronic inflammation and numerous histiocytes consistent with astromal response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (eg blocks 18 & 23).  Within the areas of altered stroma the histiocytes are highlighted with a CD68 immunostain while keratin AE1/AE3 immunostains are negative.  No residual invasive carcinoma is seen in multiple levels examined in this area and through multiple slices extending to a  separate area in which there is a similar stromal response (? site of unidentified clip - block 34). There are dispersed scattered foci of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with clinging and cribriform architecture distributed across 12mm (three consecutive slices).  No necrosis is seen and there are sparse associated microcalcifications which are also seen within benign glands.  The DCIS is 3mm clear of the superior margin (block 23L1), 9mm clear of the inferior margin (block 27L3) and well clear (>10mm) clear of the remainingmargins.  Elsewhere the breast tissue shows focal fibroadenomatoid change, ductal hyperplasia of usual type, cystically dilated ducts, patchy mild lobular and ductal chronic inflammation and focal pregnancy-like change. There are also several foci of acute inflammation presumably relating to the hookwires.

(TO: ZC:  RT/mm 2.12.63)\nMICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr U Protano)\nSections are of skin extending to deep subcutaneous tissue, including skeletal muscle at the deep aspect. The 40mm subcutaneous tumour is a high grade sarcomatoid tumour. The tumour consists of moderately to markedly atypical stellate to spindled cells withina variably fibromyxoid and hyalinised stroma. The tumour cells are arranged in sheets, poorly formed fascicular structures and in a storiform pattern surrounded by vascularised fibromyxoid stroma. Numerous highly atypical, bizarre multinucleated tumour cells are seen. In some areas, hyalinised bands of osteoid-like material separate malignant tumour cells (osteoid present in approximately 10% of tumour). Focal chondroid matrix and calcified bone formation are also seen. The tumour shows increased mitotic activity, includingscattered atypical mitoses. Very occasional foci of necrosis (up to 5%) are present. The tumour infiltrates the surrounding fibroadipose tissue and skeletal muscle, and numerous degenerate skeletal muscle fibres are seen. The surrounding adipose tissue contains scattered atypical cells, however, no lipoblasts are identified. Background epidermal and dermocutaneous changes in keeping with history of previous radiotherapy are seen. An incidental benign naevus (clear of margins) is present. \nThe margins are as follows:\n12 o'clock margin: 4.4mm (block 5).\n3 o'clock margin: Well clear (>10mm).\n6 o'clock margin: Focal positive margin (block 7).\n9 o'clock margin: Well clear (>10mm). \nDeep margin: 1.7mm (blocks 9 and 12).\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:\nImmunohistochemical stains were performed and the results are as follows:\nTumour cells positive for: Vimentin.\nTumour cells negative for: Cam5.2, Pancytokeratin, CD34, desmin, LCA, myogenin, S100 and SMA. \nKi-67: Variable, up to 15% of tumour cell nuclei positive.\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe 40mm subcutaneous righttrapezius tumour is a high grade malignant sarcomatoid tumour. The overall morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical staining are those of a high grade pleomorphic sarcoma with focal osteosarcomatous component (approximately 10%). \nThe surrounding adipose tissue contains scattered atypical stellate cells, with smudgy chromatin and cytoplasm and variably prominent nucleoli. The possibility of a dedifferentiated liposarcoma has been considered and cannotbe entirely excluded. However, the atypia in the surrounding adipose tissue may represent single cell infiltration of fat by malignant sarcoma cells, or alternatively, radiotherapy induced atypia. However, as a dedifferentiated liposarcoma cannot be entirely excluded, FISH testing for MDM2 amplification may be useful if clinically indicated. \nPlease correlate with clinical and imaging findings. \n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nLesion right trapezius: \nHigh grade pleomorphic sarcoma with focal osteosarcomatous component (approximately 10%).\nTumour present focally at 6 o'clock margin. \nPlease see comment. \n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 80Y198956B\nMEDICALRECORD: 809198.YOQ\nPATIENT: AUGENSTEIN, CLARK\nIDNUM: 80Y19895\nSTREET: Scottish\nCITY: ECHUCA\nSTATE: VIC\nZIP: 3926\nDATE: 6/4/1995=>1995-06-04\nTIME: 10/12/2013 at 08:17=>2013-12-10T08:17\nDEPARTMENT: Immunology\nHOSPITAL: WAUCHOPE DISTRICT MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\nDOCTOR: MARTY BERRY GAVILANES\nDOCTOR: ZC\nDOCTOR: RT\nDATE: 2.12.63=>2063-02-12\nDOCTOR: U Protano\n"}]}

The right ovarian parenchyma shows diffuse involvement by a well differentiated mucinous tumour. The mucinous tumour displays positive staining with CDX2 and CK 20, and negative staining with CK 7.This immunohistochemical profile is consistent with a tumour with an intestinal phenotype. Section of the right fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.\nB. The endometrium, ectocervix and endocervix show surface involvement by a well differentiated mucinous tumour with features similar to those seen in the appendix and right ovary. The myometrium contains a benign leiomyoma. The left fallopian tube shows a 1mm focus of carcinoma in situ/high grade dysplasia (Block B9). The left ovary shows no significant abnormality.\nC. The appendix has been totally blocked and examined in its entirety. The appendix shows close to total replacement of its normal mucosa with a mostly flat and focally undulating mucinous epithelial proliferation. The mucinous epithelium shows mild cytological atypia and mitoses are not prominent. The wall of the appendix displays an altered morphology in areas and appears fibrotic and hyalinised. There is no discernible lamina propria. Diverticula of the tumour areseen focally but there is no evidence of rupture or invasion. The appearance is consistent with a low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm. Normal looking colonic mucosa is seen at the resection margin of the specimen.\nD. Sections show the presence of extracellular mucin expanding the visceral peritoneum of the spleen. The appearance is consistent with pseudomyxoma peritonei although no epithelial component is identified. The splenic parenchyma shows no significant abnormality. \nE to L.

The tumour is relatively circumscribed with a thin fibrous pseudocapsule in areas, but also shows focal areas of infiltration into adjacent hepatocellular parenchyma as well as entrapment of portal structures.  The cellulartumour shows a haphazard, sheet-like and focally storiform arrangement of spindle cells with densely eosinophilic, somewhat granular cytoplasm, mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism, finely granular chromatin and single to multiple small eosinophilic nucleoli.  The tumour contains red blood cell-filled pseudovascular spaces, as well as capillary size vessels.  Occasional fibrous septa containing dilated vessels are also present.  There is a focal tumour necrosis (approximately 5% of tumour) and acute haemorrhage. Focal lymphovascular invasion is seen (block 3).  Tumour cell mitoses number up to 28 per 10hpf.  The tumour is 1.1mm from the resection margin (block 2)\nImmunohistochemistry:  \nThe tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive - CD34 (multifocal), Vimentin.\nEquivocal - EMA (patchy peripheral staining with background staining of liver)\nNegative - CAM 5.2, Pan CK, AE1/AE3, Desmin, S100, HMB 45, Melan A, CD31, Hepar-1, CD117 (patchy minimal cytoplasmic staining with background cytoplasmic staining of  hepatocytes.)\nCOMMENT 1:\nThe features are consistent with metastatic unclassifiable spindle cell sarcoma.  Unclassifiable spindle cell sarcoma was the diagnosis made on review by Prof. LOWELL PICCIONI in 2060 for the original pelvic tumour ; a more specific diagnosis was not possible.  The minimal patchy cytoplasmic CD117 staining with background hepatocellular staining in this case, is regarded as a negative result, especially in the context of previous negative DOG1 staining on two separate occasions.  \nThe adjacent liver shows overall preservedlobular architecture with very mild patchy portal chronic inflammation, mild fibrous expansion and focal linkage of portal tracts. There is very mild proliferation of bile ductules and periductal concentric fibrosis and possible oedema. A focal intraductal aggregate of acute inflammatory cells is also noted.  No steatosis or lobular inflammation is seen.  There is mild periportal hepatocyte copper deposition on rhodanine staining.  No stainable iron seen on Perls staining.  No dPAS positive globules seen. \nCOMMENT 2:\nThe adjacent non-tumour liver shows changes suggestive of biliary obstruction, however, these changes may represent local effects secondaryto proximity to tumour.

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy.  Uterus, tubes, ovaries, cervix, rectosigmoid colon, omentum, colon donuts.  Ovarian cancer.  \nMACROSCOPIC:\nA.  Specimen labelled \"Uterus, tubes, ovaries, cervix, rectosigmoid colon\" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, right and left adnexa, attached rectosigmoid colon and mesenteric fat received en bloc. \nThe uterus measures 75 x 45 x 50mm.  The serosal surface of the uterus is covered in multiple fibrous adhesions which completely obliterate the pouch of Douglas.  The uterus is adherent to the bowel posteriorly.  On opening the uterus three endometrial uterine polyps are present measuring 15 to 45mm.  The endometrium otherwise is 1mm in maximum thickness over a total wall thickness of 30mm.The myometrium is unremarkable.  The left adnexa contains a cystic structure measuring 45 x 40 x 30mm.  The cyst is unilocular with a wall thickness of 3mm.  Two solid cream masses are located adjacent to the cyst measuring 30 x 25 x 20mm and 13 x 10 x 12mm.  A possible fallopian tube is identified embedded within the larger mass.  The right adnexa containsa dark grey cystic structure measuring 45 x 35 x 25mm with a wall thickness of 5mm.  Within this cyst a tubular structure is identified ?fallopian tube.  No fimbria are identified.\nThe attached segment of bowel measures 355mm in length and is received entangled in a loop with multiple fibrous adhesions.  One end, the presumed proximal end, is stapled shut, while the other end is open.  The bowel wall appears indurated in areas with a maximum wall thickness of 15mm.  These indurated areas are approximately 90mm from the proximal margin and 100mm from the distal margin.  No mucosal lesions are identified.  A moderate amount of mesenteric fat is located on the posterior aspect of the specimen, measuring approximately 100 x 70mm.  Several lymph nodes are identified in the mesenteric fat. \nThe stapled end of the bowel is inked black.  The free end is inked blue.  Vaginal cuff margin inked blue.  \nBlocks: 1 - proximal bowel margin; 2 - distal bowel margin; 3 to 11 - full section of posterior uterine cervix and body (5 & 6, 7 to 9, 10 & 11 are paired blocks); 12 - __ section of uterine polyp; 13 - section anterior cervix; 14 - section of left adnexal mass; 15 - section of second left adnexal mass; 16 - ?fimbrial end of left fallopian tube; 17 - ?left fallopian tube; 18 - representative cyst wall left adnexal mass; 19 - right adnexal cyst wall; 20 - representative TS right fallopian tube; 21-23 sections of indurated area bowel wall; 24 & 25 - lymph nodes (YO 1/7/63).

Specimen labelled \"Proximal and distal bowel donuts\" consists of two pieces of bowel wall, the first measuring 25 x 15 x 10mm and the second measuring15 x 10 x 4mm.  \nBlocks: 1 & 2 - larger piece; 3 - smaller piece. \nC.  Specimen labelled \"Omentum\" consists of a piece of omentum measuring 240 x 110 x 25mm.  The central portion is involved by cream tumour.  The tumour measures 100 x 85 x 20mm.  Representative sections in 3 blocks.  \n(ON/ta 1/7/63) \nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr X Fontenette): \nA.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable.  Sections of the endometrium show that this is thin andinactive.  The endometrial polyps are benign.  There is extensive tumour within fibrofat adherent to the serosa of the posterior uterus and within adhesions between the loops of rectosigmoid colon and the posterior uterus.  Tumour extends from the serosal surface of the uterus some distance into the underlying outer myometrium.  The tumour has features most consistent with a moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.  Some psammoma bodies are noted.  There is some evidence of treatment effect with replacement of tumour by dense fibrous tissue; there is between 10 and 50% tumour replacement by fibrous tissue.  \nBoth ovaries are identified in sections from the right and left adnexal tissues.  There is extensive tumour within adherent fibrous tissue on the surface ofboth ovaries but there is minimal tumour involvement of the deeper ovarian tissue.  Portions of both fallopian tubes are also identified in sections from both adnexa.  There is extensive tumour within soft tissue adherent to the outer surfaces of bothfallopian tubes.  One section from the fimbrial end of the right tube appears to show a focus of carcinoma in situ of residual tubal epithelium (block A20); the sections of residual fallopian tube are otherwise unremarkable.\nSections from the indurated segments of the rectosigmoid colon show extensive tumour within fibrofat adherent to the bowel serosa, andextending some distance into the underlying outer muscularis propria.  No tumour involvement of the bowel mucosa or submucosa is seen.  A total of nine lymph nodes were identified in the attached mesenteric fat and these are all free oftumour.  There is focal tumour involvement of the bowel serosa at the proximal excision margin.  \nB.  Sections show pieces of essentially unremarkable large intestinal wall.  No tumour is seen.  \nC.  Sections show omental fat with extensive involvement by poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.  There is minimal histologic evidence of treatment effect.  \nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.  Uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes and rectosigmoid colon:\n-  Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving serosa and outer myometrium of uterus, serosa and outer muscularis propria of rectosigmoid colon, soft tissue adhesions between loops of rectosigmoid colon and posterior uterus, right and left parametrial soft tissues and serosa of ovaries and fallopian tubes.  Focal carcinoma in situ at fimbrial end of left tube.  \nB.  Proximal and distal bowel donuts:\n-  No tumour.  \nC.  Omentum:  \n-  Poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.  \nCOMMENT:\nThe distribution of the disease is most consistent with a primary peritoneal serous carcinoma, however the focal apparent carcinoma in situ at the fimbrial end of the right tube raises the possibility of tubal origin. \n \n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 87M609197U\nMEDICALRECORD: 8746091.ZUU\nPATIENT: BREDICE, SUMAYA\nIDNUM: 87M60919\nSTREET: Halnaker\nCITY: CESSNOCK\nSTATE: ACT\nZIP: 2316\nDATE: 7/10/1990=>1990-07-10\nTIME: 04/11/2013 at 13:13=>2013-11-04T13:13\nDEPARTMENT: WEST GYNAECOLOGY\nHOSPITAL: INNISFAIL HOSPITAL\nDOCTOR: REID IGNACIO HURSEY\nDOCTOR: YO\nDATE: 1/7/63=>2063-01-07\nDOCTOR: ND\nDATE: 1/8/63=>2063-01-08\nDOCTOR: ON\nDATE: 1/7/63=>2063-01-07\nDOCTOR: X Fontenette\n"}]}

Improved survival with vemurafenib in melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation.  N Engl J Med 2011; 364:2507-16). \nMethod:\n*DNA was extracted from FFPE tumour tissue using the Roche cobas DNA Sample Preparation kit.\n*BRAF gene mutations were analysed using the Roche cobas BRAF V600 Mutation Test kit (ARTG: 298901). \nCOMMENTS:\n*This test is intended as an adjunct to other prognostic and predictive factors to aid clinical treatment decisions. \n* This test does not specify the activating BRAF gene mutation that causes a substitution of the Valine at codon 600 (p.V600) of the BRAF protein. The test detects the common BRAF p.V600E (c.1799T>A) mutation, which occursin >80% of BRAF positive tumours, and may also detect some (but NOT all) activating BRAF p.V600K mutations, which occur in up to 17% of BRAF positive tumours. Other rare activating BRAF mutations affecting p.V600 may NOT be detected bythis analysis, therefore a negative result should be interpreted with caution. Other mutations, either in the BRAF gene or in other genes, will not be detected by this analysis. \n*This test has been shown in our laboratory to detect at least 5% mutant BRAF alleles in a background of normal DNA. Therefore a negative result should be interpreted with caution, as it does not exclude the presence of lowlevels of an activating BRAF mutation. \n*The analytical sensitivity and specificity of this test for the p.V600E mutation are 99.6% and 97.9%, respectively. PCR inhibitors or rare mutations affecting the binding sites of PCR primers and/or probes may cause a false negative result.\n*This test has been processed as a Level 1 genetic test according to the NPAAC guidelines (2007).\n*Only the testing performed byour laboratory is covered by NATA accreditation, not the referenced material used for clinical interpretation of this testing\". \n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "MEDICALRECORD: 2989019.BMQ\nPATIENT: MCCORKELL, ROBERT DONTE\nIDNUM: 29V90190\nDATE: 22/1/2063=>2063-01-22\nDATE: 21.1.63=>2063-01-21\nDOCTOR: ZB\nDOCTOR: UQ\nDATE: 8.1.63=>2063-01-08\nDOCTOR: H Luzuriaga\nDATE: 21.1.63=>2063-01-21\nDOCTOR: H Stricklind\nDEPARTMENT: ACT Genetic\nIDNUM: 298901\n"}]}

Improved survival with vemurafenib in melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation.  N Engl J Med 2011; 364:2507-16). \nMethod:\n*DNA was extracted from FFPE tumour tissue using the Roche cobas DNA Sample Preparation kit.\n*BRAF gene mutations were analysed using the Roche cobas BRAF V600 Mutation Test kit (ARTG: 903325). \nCOMMENTS:\n*This test is intended as an adjunct to other prognostic and predictive factors to aid clinical treatment decisions. \n* This test does not specify the activating BRAF gene mutation that causes a substitution of the Valine at codon 600 (p.V600) of the BRAF protein. The test detects the common BRAFp.V600E (c.1799T>A) mutation, which occurs in >80% of BRAF positive tumours, and may also detect some (but NOT all) activating BRAF p.V600K mutations, which occur in up to 17% of BRAF positive tumours. Other rare activating BRAF mutations affecting p.V600 may NOT be detected by this analysis, therefore a negative result should be interpreted with caution. Other mutations, either in the BRAF gene or in other genes, will not be detected by this analysis. \n*This test has been shown in our laboratory to detect at least 5% mutant BRAF alleles in a background of normal DNA. Therefore a negative result should be interpreted with caution, as it does not exclude the presence of low levels of an activating BRAF mutation. \n*The analytical sensitivity and specificity of this test for the p.V600E mutation are 99.6% and 97.9%, respectively. PCR inhibitors or rare mutations affecting the binding sites of PCR primers and/or probes may cause a false negative result.\n*This test has been processed as a Level 1 genetic test according to the NPAAC guidelines (2007).\n*Only the testing performed by our laboratory is covered by NATA accreditation, not the referenced material used for clinical interpretation of this testing\". \n \n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 90J325811R\nMEDICALRECORD: 9033258.DDR\nPATIENT: SCHNACK, YARRAN\nIDNUM: 90J32581\nSTREET: Geralynn\nCITY: LAKES ENTRANCE\nSTATE: VIC\nZIP: 6725\nDATE: 24/10/1985=>1985-10-24\nTIME: 25/11/2013 at 08:12=>2013-11-25T08:12\nDEPARTMENT: DAY SURGERY\nHOSPITAL: SUNSHINE COAST UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL\nDOCTOR: PERCY LINDSEY SOWELL\nDOCTOR: YG\nDATE: 28/1/63=>2063-01-28\nDOCTOR: Y Finster\nHOSPITAL: THE CANBERRA HOSPITAL\nDATE: 2.5.63=>2063-02-05\nDOCTOR: Y Balbi\nHOSPITAL: YEA AND DISTRICT MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\nPATIENT: NGUNYA DAIN\nIDNUM: 903325\n"}]}

Sections show three separate invasive carcinomas (2.5mm ductal,NST, 0.8mm microinvasive ductal. NST and less than 0.1mm microinvasive ductal respectively) arising within, or close to, a contiguous area of high grade ductal carcinoma in-situ (DCIS) measuring 12.2mm in maximum dimension.  The invasive foci are too small for formal grading but are composed of scattered solid nests of cells (tubules =3) with grade 3 nuclei.  The possibility that these foci represent displacement artefact related to previous core biopsy sampling was considered, as the foci are present either in proximity to haemosiderin-laden macrophages within altered fibrotic stroma, or close to foci of fat necrosis, however, the altered cytological features of the nests compared with the adjacent DCIS, and overall distribution strongly favours an interpretation of invasive/microinvasive carcinoma.  Someof the nests have a papillform irregular profile and peritumoural spaces, the latter interpreted as retraction spaces, however, the possibility of lymphovascular invasion cannot entirely be excluded.  The invasive carcinoma (2.5mm focus) is 4.2mm clear of the closest (superficial) margin and well clear of the other margins; the two other microinvasive foci are further from the superficial margin.  Unfortunately, immunostaining to assess for myoepithelial cells (P63, CK5/6) and receptor status (ER, PR, HER2) is non-contributory due to these foci either cutting out or because of obscuring distortion artefact.  The DCIS is strongly ER positive.\nAlthough the location of the DCIS was grossly identified in what was thought to be the lower inner quadrant of the breast, a post operative radiograph of one of the blocks containing DCIS (A36) confirms the presence of a marking clip, and the location is therefore 4'clock 5cm FN from the nipple, as determined clinically.  The DCIS is solid and comedo in type with scattered associated microcalcifications and there is periduct fibrosis and cancerisation of lobules. The DCIS is 3.7mm clear of the closest (superficial) margin and well clear of the other margins.  Away from this area the breast tissue also shows foci of columnat cell change, columnar cell hyperplasia and a focus of flat epithelial atypia.  Scattered benign glandular calcifications are present.  \nShown to A/Prof N Freddrick and Dr N Czubakowski.\nInvasive carcinoma:\nSite:  Left breast; 4 o'clock, 5cm FN.\nType:  Ductal, NST x1, microinvasive ductal, NST x2.\nInvasive tumour size:  2.5mm, 0.8mm and less than 0.1mm\nGrade (Modified Bloom & Richardson):  Too small for formal grading but not grade 1.\nTubules:  3  Nuclei:  3  Mitoses:  insufficient fields  Mitotic rate: 0/10hpf.\nLymphovascular invasion:  Indefinite (see above).\n\t    \nDCIS component:  \nDCIS:  Present\nMaximum extent of DCIS: 12.2mm\nNuclear grade: High\nArchitecture:  Solid and comedo.\nNecrosis:  Present.\nCalcification:  Present.\nDCIS in adjacent tissue:  Nil\nExcision Margins:  \nInvasive component:  superficial - 4.2mm (C36L2), other margins well clear>10mm.\nIn-situ component:  superficial 3.7mm  (C37), other margins well clear.\nReceptors:  Notdetermined for invasive carcinoma; tumour tissue cut out/distortion artefact precludes assessment.

Known prostate CA.?2 lesions (see PET).  \nMACROSCOPIC:\nA.  Specimen labelled \"Right upper lobe\" consists of a lobectomy specimen which measures 35 x 125 x 105mm and weighs 277g.  The pleural surface contains an exophyticlesion which measures 25 x 23mm.  This lesion is located peripherally approximately 40mm from the bronchial margin. At the apical pole there is an area of pleural thickening which measures 15mm in maximum diameter. No other discrete lesions are identified. The remainder of the lung parenchyma appears unremarkable.

Specimen labelled \"Right subcarinal\" consists of one lymph node, 15mm in maximum diameter. Serially sectioned and AE 1 block. \n\nMICROSCOPIC:  (Reported byDr R Kucharski):\nA.  The exophytic subpleural lesion shows dense fibrosis with interstitial extension into the lung parenchyma.  In this area the pleural cavity is obliterated with a dense fibrous adhesion between parietal and visceral pleura.  Skeletal muscle is attached to the parietal pleura.  Thetype 2 pneumocytes at the periphery of the lesion are atypical with prominent nucleoli and even intranuclear inclusions.  However,the appearance favours reactive atypia rather than atypical adenomatous hyperplasia.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  In the area of scaring there is an occasional necrotising granuloma but no acid fast organisms are seen in the Fitestain.  \nThe lobe also shows an apical scar with subpleural bulla.  The lung parenchyma away from these lesions shows no significant abnormality.  The lung hilum including  two (2) hilar lymph nodes shows no abnormality.  \nB.  The eight (8) lymphnodes identified are negative for tumour.\nC.  The lymph node is negative for tumour.\nD.  The lymph node is negative for tumour.\nDIAGNOSIS:  \nA.  Right upper lobe:  Subpleural scar (?old Ghon focus) with adhesion and atypical type 2 pneumocytes - see below.\n- Apical scar.\nB.  Station 4R:\n- Lymph nodes (x8) negative for tumour.\nC.  Pulmonary ligament lymphnode:  \n- Lymph node (x1) negative for tumour.\nD.  Right subcarinal lymph node:\n- Lymph node (x1) negative for tumour.\nCOMMENT:\nI have reported this case in consultation with Dr ISMAEL AGUILAR and Dr BOB MCKIE and am aware of the previous core biopsy and FNA reports (66Q82010, 66Q82010).  While the type 2 pneumocytes at the periphery of the subpleural scar are undoubtedly atypical the appearance falls short of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia.  The appearance favours reactive atypia.  The subpleural scar contains a necrotising granuloma and this may represent an old Ghon focus.  \n \n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 66Q820107M\nMEDICALRECORD: 6668201.ASM\nPATIENT: VIZCARRA, JOSHUA\nIDNUM: 66Q82010\nSTREET: Bondmark\nCITY: WILTON\nSTATE: SA\nZIP: 3273\nDATE: 1/10/1990=>1990-01-10\nDATE: 19/11/2063=>2063-11-19\nDEPARTMENT: PERI-OPERATIVEUNIT\nDOCTOR: DELMAR CHRISTOPHER ANGELOCCI\nDOCTOR: Prekker\nDOCTOR: Lich\nDOCTOR: QJ\nDOCTOR: TU\nDATE: 19.11.63=>2063-11-19\nDOCTOR: R Kucharski\nDOCTOR: ISMAEL AGUILAR\nDOCTOR: BOB MCKIE\nIDNUM: 66Q82010\nIDNUM: 66Q82010\n"}]}

Right kidney and proximal ureter.\nMACROSCOPIC:\nSpecimen labelled \"R kidney\" consists of a nephrectomy specimen measuring 160 x 90 x 35mm and weighing 210g.  The kidney is incompletely covered by perirenal fat.  External surface inked black. On opening the kidney, the ureter is 55mm in length and appears markedly dilated with a maximum diameter of 24mm.  The ureteric wall appears attenuated and no papillary excrescences are present. The renal calyces appear dilated with blunting of the renal papillae. The renal cortex is 17mm in maximum thickness.  No mass or lesions are identified.  The perinephric fat appears mature, there is no evidenceof tumour.\nBlocks:  1 - ureteric margin; 2 to 6 - representative kidney; 7- renal pelvis; 8- dilated proximal ureter; 9-10- representative perinephric fat  (TO: AG; DZ/rt 21.11.63)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr G Mastenbrook):\nSections show of ureter and kidney show changes consistent with hydronephrosis.  The dilated ureter and renal pelvis contain a mild patchy chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate within the lining urothelium and underlying stroma.  The kidney shows mild to moderate patchy interstitial nephritis with a mixed chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate.  There is only minimal tubular atrophy and patchy mild glomerulosclerosis.  An occasional cortical scar is seen, however, the cortex is generally preserved.  The non-sclerosed glomeruli and renal vessels appear unremarkable.  A simple cortical cyst is present.  The perinephric and periureteric adipose tissue is mostly mature with a focus of brown fat.   No evidence of periureteric desmoid tumour is seen. There is no evidence of malignancy.  \nCOMMENT:\nThe kidney shows changes consistent with hydronephrosis.  The cause of the obstruction is not identified within the specimen and is presumably distal to the ureteric resection margin.  \nDIAGNOSIS:\nRight kidney and proximal ureter:  \n-  Hydronephrosis with mild to moderate chronic interstitial nephritis (see comment).  \n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "MEDICALRECORD: 2126842.SET\nPATIENT: FYFE, LOUIE\nIDNUM: 21G68427\nDATE: 26/11/2063=>2063-11-26\nDOCTOR: AG\nDOCTOR: DZ\nDATE: 21.11.63=>2063-11-21\nDOCTOR: G Mastenbrook\n"}]}

The cervix and vaginal vault have been embedded in their entirety. Sections of the cervical tumour show a poorly differentiated keratinising squamous cell carcinoma in several sections, arising on a background of extensive CIN 3. \nThe carcinoma largely effaces the cervical mucosa, has a maximum depth of invasion of 21mm and extends up to 30mm in length along the cervical canal. The carcinoma extends to the ectocervical, peripheral soft tissue margin and shows widespread involvement of the defect (main specimen). CIN3 also extends to the ectocervical margin. There is widespread lymph-vascular space invasion and focal perineural involvement. No convincing glandular dysplasia is identified. \nIn the separately received vaginal vault specimen, the superior portion shows extensive involvement by poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Carcinoma undermines the vaginal epithelium. Carcinoma is up to 22mm in thickness and infiltrates the full thickness of the specimen toinvolve the superior soft tissue (peripheral) margins. Carcinoma is 8mm from the inferior margin. There is focal VAIN 3 which is clear of the margins.\nThe endometrium is inactive and there is multifocal adenomyosis and endometriosis. The bilateral ovaries and fallopian tube show no significant abnormality. An incidental adrenocortical rest is present adjacent to the left ovary. \nB.  Sections of the six right obturator lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma (0/6).\nC.  Sections of the three left obturator lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma (0/3). \nD.  Sections of the two right external iliac lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma (0/2). \nE.

Sections of the two right common iliac lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma (0/2).\nG.  Sections of the left common iliac lymph node show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma (0/1).\nH.  Sections show mature fibroadipose tissue containing scattered blood vessels. There is no evidence of malignancy. \nCOMMENT:\nThe 25 sampled lymph nodes show no evidence of metastatic carcinoma. However, many of the lymphnodes show at least partial effacement by enlarged neoplastic follicles, which consist predominantly of centrocytes. The neoplastic follicles are positive for CD10 and BCL-2; and are negative with T-cell markers (CD3, CD5, CD43) and cyclin D1. The neoplastic lymphoid infiltrate also shows focal extranodal extension. These morphologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with the history of known low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of follicular subtype. There is no convincing evidence of high grade (large cell) lymphoma. \nRepresentative slides seen with Dr CLEMENTE HOLZNER.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.   Uterus, cervix, bilateral tubes/ovaries and vaginal vault:\nPoorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix arising on a backgroundof extensive CIN 3.\nCarcinoma extends into the cervical wall up to depth of 21mm and extends along the cervical canal up to 30mm. \nMultifocal lymphovascular space invasion and perineural involvement are present. \nCarcinoma is present at the ectocervical margin, peripheral soft tissue margin and shows extensive involvement of the defect seen macroscopically; CIN 3 extends focally to the ectocervical margin.\nAdditional vaginal vault specimen shows extensive involvement of the superior portion, including the peripheral soft tissue margin, while carcinoma isat least 8mm from the inferior margin. \n\nB.

Previous mammotome excision.  Hookwire localised wide excision.  Sutures: short superior, long lateral, medium medial. \nMACROSCOPIC:\nSpecimen labelled \"Left breast lesion, long lateral, medium medial, small superior\", consists of a piece of fibrofatty tissue with one hookwire in the superficial margin and three sutures for orientation as above. The specimen measures 50mm medial to lateral, 60mm superior to inferior and 25mm from the superficial to the deep margin. Superficial margin inked blue, deep margin inked black, medial margin inked red, lateral margin green. The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior into ten slices; slice 1- superior margin; slice 10 -inferior margin.  On sectioning and in slices 2-6 there are fibrous areas with a small area of calcification in slice 6 measuring 5mm in maximum diameter. The specimen is AE according to the attached diagram.  \nBlocks 1 &  2- superior margin (slice 1); 3 & 4 - slice 2; 5 & 6 - slice 3; 7-9 - slice 4; 10-12 - slice 5; 13 & 14 - slice 6; 15 & 16 - slice 7; 17 & 18 - slice 8; 19 & 20 - slice 9; 21-22 - inferior margin (slice 10).  (XX/ec 10.4.63) \n \nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof B Arquitt):\nThe sections of breast tissue show high grade ductal carcinoma in situ displaying periductal fibrosis, extension into lobules and comedo necrosis. Most of the DCIS appears non-calcified. Some of the involved ducts are distorted, but no definite invasion is seen in the H&E stained sections. Special stains are in progress.\nHigh grade DCIS is also seen to involve scattered ducts in a Pagetoid fashion.\nThe DCIS measures approximately 35mm in greatest extent and is present in 7 out of 10 slices.\nThe surrounding breast tissue shows numerous foci of florid epithelial hyperplasia, some of which resemble small radial scars and sclerosing papillomas. Organising fibrosis, consistent with a previous biopsy site is identified.\nDCIS extends to the medial margin in a numberof slices. In some foci the margin involvement appears to be the true medial margin and in other areas DCIS extends to the junction between the medial/superficial and medial/deep margins.\nThis result was discussed with Dr B TJINGALI-Haycock.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nLEFT BREAST: HIGH GRADE DUCTAL CARCINOMA IN SITU\nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: \nDeeper levels and special stains (p63, keratin 5/6, AE1/AE3) were performedon selected blocks.\nBlock 7 demonstrated a small focus of invasive carcinoma which is present in the immunoperoxidase stained sections but was not apparent in the original H&E stained sections. Further H&E stained sections were therefore examined. \nThis focus measures approximately 2mm and is adjacent to ducts containing high grade DCIS. \nThe focus of invasive carcinoma is 0.5mm from the adjacent deep (black inked) margin. \nThe centre of the carcinomaconsists of fibrous tissue and chronic inflammatory cells with a rim of viable tumour at the periphery. The small amount of tumour makes grading difficult, but would score 3 for tubules and 3 for nuclei. Mitoses are difficult to see butin one high power field with well preserved tumour cells up to 4 mitoses are seen. \nOverall the features would favour a grade 3 carcinoma.  \nNo lymphovasuclar invasion is seen.\nThe tumour cells show very weak estrogen receptor staining of occasional tumour nuclei. Progesterone receptor is negative (both sections contain a positive control).\nKi67 expression is high (approximately 60%).\nHer 2 immunoperoxidase staining shows 2 - 3+ staining. SISH is in progress.\nNo other foci of invasion area identified although there are areas of duct disruption (with extrusion of comedo necrosis) and distortion throughout the DCIS, making interpretation difficult.\nThe sections were shown to a number of pathologists within the department (including Drs B Ritchlin and B Berno) and there is consensus that this is a true focus of invasion.\nThis additional finding was discussed with Dr B KEVIN-Coggin by A/Prof B Klingensmith on 10/5/63. \nREVISED DIAGNOSIS: \nSMALL FOCUS OF INVASIVE CARCINOMA FOUND IN ADDITIONAL LEVELS AND SPECIAL STAINS.\n***ADDITIONAL REPORT:  (23.8.63)  TD\nBlocks weresent to PETERBOROUGH CAMPUS Hospital for Her2 ISH analysis, Dr B Sane reports:\nHER2 IHC Result:   Equivocal (2+).\nSignal Detection has been performed for the Her2gene (17q21) and chromosome 17 centromeric enumeration probe (CEP17) control using the Ventanta INFORM Her2 Dual ISH DNA Probe Cocktail Assay (Roche). \nHer2 Dual ISH result: POSITIVE (amplified).\nMean Her2 copy number per cell: 16.2.\nMean CEP17 copynumber per cell:  1.6.\nHER2/CEP17 ratio:  10.12.\nSCORING CRITERIA (ASCO/CAP recommendations):\nNegative:  HER2/CEP17 <1.8.\nEquivocal:  HER2/CEP17 = 1.8-2.2.\nPositive:  HER2/CEP17 >2.2.\n \n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 02G275306N\nMEDICALRECORD: 0222753.AQN\nPATIENT: SCHIFF, DUANE ORLI NARA\nIDNUM: 02G27530\nSTREET: Molteg\nCITY: DAMPIER\nSTATE: SA\nZIP: 3463\nDATE: 4/10/2007=>2007-10-04\nTIME: 07/02/2013 at 15:45=>2013-02-07T15:45\nDEPARTMENT: RHW\nHOSPITAL: GREAT OCEAN ROAD HEALTH - LORNE COMMUNITY HOSPITAL\nDOCTOR: OLLIE RAYFORD DINO-GRUNDY\nDOCTOR: ALBERT\nDOCTOR: XX\nDATE: 10.4.63=>2063-04-10\nDOCTOR: B Arquitt\nDOCTOR: B TJINGALI-Haycock\nDOCTOR: B Ritchlin\nDOCTOR: B Berno\nDOCTOR: B KEVIN-Coggin\nDOCTOR: B Klingensmith\nDATE: 10/5/63=>2063-05-10\nDATE: 23.8.63=>2063-08-23\nHOSPITAL: PETERBOROUGH CAMPUS\nDOCTOR: B Sane\n"}]}

(BJ/cc  14/4/63) \n  \nMICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr P Panny - 15.4.2063)\nA. The right breast lesion is a circumscribed, unencapsulated fibroepithelial lesion. The fibroadenoma is composed of numerous ducts showing a mixed pericanalicular and intracanalicular pattern and surrounded by variably sclerotic fibromyxoid stroma. Some of the ducts show periductal cleft formation. The stroma consists of plump spindled cells and is moderate to highly cellular in areas, although no periductal cellular accentuation is seen. There is no stromal overgrowth, significant cytologic atypia or mitotic activity (less than 1 mitoses/hpf). The fibroepithelial lesion is surrounded by a variably thick cuff of fibroadipose breast tissue (0.25mm inareas) and focally extends to the inked margin. There is no atypical ductal hyperplasia, DCIS or evidence of invasive malignancy. \nB.  The right breast lesion is a fibroadenoma. The fibroadenoma is composed of benign ducts showing a mixed pericanalicular and intracanalicular pattern and surrounded by variably sclerotic fibrous stroma. The fibroadenoma extends to the inked/diathermied margins in areas. There are no atypical features or evidence of a phyllodes tumour. There is no atypical ductal hyperplasia, DCIS or evidence of invasive malignancy. \nCOMMENT:\nThe 3 o'clock right breast lesion is a fibroepithelial tumour. The lesion has unusually high stromal cellularity, but there is no convincing stromal overgrowth, peri-ductal accentuation of cellularity, stromal cell atypia or significant mitotic activity (less than 1 mitoses/hpf). Although a low grade Phyllodes tumour was considered in the differential diagnosis due to the high stromal cellularity, in the absence of any other atypical features the favoured diagnosis is a cellular (juvenile) fibroadenoma. \nRepresentative slides seen with Associate Professor P Stabb.\nPlease correlate with clinical and imaging findings. \n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.  Right breast 3 o'clock lesion: Fibroepithelial lesion, favour cellular (juvenile) fibroadenoma, present focally at margin (see comment). \n\nB.

Further immunostains for T cell subsets have been performed as requested.\nThere are numerous CD4 positive Tcells in the tissue.  Most of these are associated with macrophages in areas of fibroblastic tissue and fat necrosis; these are interpreted as being part of a non-specific inflammatory reaction in the settingof previous chemotherapy treatment.  However some CD4 positive cells are seen in intimate association with groups of residual, apparent viable, tumour cells.\nThere is also a moderate number of CD8 positive cells in the tissue (fewer than CD4 positive cells).

He replies as follows:\n\"I agree with your description and differential diagnosis of pilocytic astrocytoma vs piloid gliosis.  I think the degree of degenerative atypia present is somewhat suggestive of pilocytic astrocytoma but I do not think there is any morphological feature in this case that is able to conclusive distinguish between these two entities.  Microcystic change is often suggested as a way as distinguishing them (present in some pilocytic astrocytomas), but its absence in this case does not help.  \nMy main concerns are that this lady is not in the typical age range for pilocytic astrocytoma and that the biopsy is from the periphery of the lesion. Spinal cord tumours are notorious for producing florid piloid gliosis and I am suspicious that the main lesion identifiedradiologically has not been included in this biopsy material. \n\nSUMMARY:  \nPiloid gliosis vs pilocytic astrocytoma, see above\". \n\n\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 03E930282N\nMEDICALRECORD: 031930.GVG\nPATIENT: CORDOVANO, TORA PANSY\nIDNUM: 03E93028\nSTREET: Northview\nCITY: MOUNT GAMBIER\nSTATE: Victoria\nZIP: 4580\nDATE: 26/3/1980=>1980-03-26\nTIME: 06/02/2013 at 11:42=>2013-02-06T11:42\nDEPARTMENT: DICKINSON 3 NORTH\nHOSPITAL: ARMIDALE RURAL REFERRAL HOSPITAL\nDOCTOR: MAXWELL WILLARD BRADLEY-AUCK\nDATE: 27.4.63=>2063-04-27\nDOCTOR: B Mozelak\nDOCTOR: B Vanover\nDOCTOR: B Kreidler\nDOCTOR: B Mccalop\nTIME: 2.10pm on 6/2/13=>2013-02-06T14:10\nDOCTOR: WV\nDOCTOR: IG\nDATE: 9/4/63=>2063-04-09\nDOCTOR: B Siddle\nDOCTOR: HENRY GORTON\nHOSPITAL: CULCAIRN MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE HOSPITAL\nDATE: 27.4.63=>2063-04-27\nDOCTOR: CAREY DELUNEY\nHOSPITAL: ROYAL TALBOT REHABILITATION CENTRE\n"}]}

(TO: KB; DX/ta 23/4/63) \nBlock 1- the frozen section 2 - the remainder AE\n  \nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Hardaker):\nSections show fat depleted hypercellular parathyroid tissue composed predominantly of sheets of chief cells with some intervening transitional oncocyte and clear cell areas.  A portion of the tumour is invested in a fibrous capsule within which there are entrapped nests of parathyroid cells.  Scattered typical mitoses are seen (numbering up to 2 per 10 hpf) but no necrosis or significant nuclear pleomorphism is seen.  No definite transcapsular invasion, lymphovascular invasion or perineural invasion is seen.  A small portion of adjacent normal parathyroid tissue is present.\nCOMMENT:\nThe features are those of hypercellular parathyroid tissue weighing 350mg.  Providing the residual parathyroid glands are of normal size, the appearances are consistent with a parathyroid adenoma.  The area of fibrosis within and at the periphery of the nodule contains nests of parathyroid tissue, the latter strongly favoured to represent entrapment rather than capsular invasion. \nI am referring the case to Professor MITCH SCHLAUCH at West Pathology, INVERELL DISTRICT HOSPITAL Hospital for his opinion and probable parafibromin and PGP9.5 analysis.\nDIAGNOSIS:  \nLeft parathyroid:  Cellular fat depleted parathyroid tissue weighing 350mg (see comment).\nSupplementary report to follow.  \n\nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT:  5.6.63\nReport from BRIGHAM & WOMEN'S HOSPITAL Pathology, WINTON:\nReported by:  A/Prof Besso:\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC: \nThank you for the opportunity to see the slides form this parathyroid.  The slides show a nodule of fat depleted parathyroid tissue with an adjacent rim of non-neoplastic parathyroid.  The features indicate parathyroid adenoma.  A little fibrosis is noted at one edge extending into the gland.  This gives the appearance of regenerative change after an episode of cyst rupture/repair rather than representing invasive growth.  In this setting I would not consider it an atypical finding.\nImmunohistochemistry is as follows: \nParafibromin: Positive\nPG P9.5: Negative\nThis is the normal pattern of staining which makes HRPT2/CDC73 mutation unlikely.\nSUMMARY:\nParathyroid adenoma 350mg\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 88N730329G\nMEDICALRECORD: 885730.IGX\nPATIENT: MAZIERSKI, JUNIOR\nIDNUM: 88N73032\nSTREET: Morani\nCITY: DERBY\nSTATE: NT\nZIP: 2537\nDATE: 24/12/1997=>1997-12-24\nDATE: 22/4/2063=>2063-04-22\nDEPARTMENT: Hunter Area\nHOSPITAL: BARWON HEALTH - MCKELLAR CENTRE CAMPUS\nDOCTOR: ELDEN STAN SAUCE\nDATE: 5.6.63=>2063-05-06\nDOCTOR: V Pierce\nTIME: 9.30am 20/2/13=>2013-02-20T09:30\nDOCTOR: KB\nDOCTOR: DX\nDATE: 23/4/63=>2063-04-23\nDOCTOR: V Hardaker\nDOCTOR: MITCH SCHLAUCH\nDEPARTMENT: West\nHOSPITAL: INVERELL DISTRICT HOSPITAL\nDATE: 5.6.63=>2063-05-06\nDEPARTMENT: BRIGHAM & WOMEN'S HOSPITAL\nCITY: WINTON\nDOCTOR: Besso\n"}]}

Specimen labelled Uterus/cervix/left tube/ovary\" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, left fallopian tube and ovary weighing 94g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 50 x 35mm and on the anterior serosa has haemorrhagic and ?fibrinous material attached.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 20mm and appears unremarkable.  The endometrium is 2mm in maximal thickness and the myometrium is 23mm in maximal thickness.  The myometrium contains several fibroids up to 15mm.  All fibroids appear whorled and some are calcified.  The left fallopian tube measures 55mm in length with a maximum diameter of 5mm.  The left ovary measures 30 x 25 x 25mm.  The cut surface reveals a cyst, 20mm in maximum dimension, which is thin walled and has a smooth inner lining and contains green mucoid material.

Specimen labelled \"Cul de sac\" consists of a tan haemorrhagic andfatty piece of tissue, 65 x 45 x 35mm.  There is peritoneum on three surfaces.  Apparent tumour is seen on the surface in several foci.  The cut surface reveals a haemorrhagic cream tumour involving the majority of the specimen.  Representative sections in 4 blocks.  \nD.  Specimen labelled \"Omentum and bowel\" consists of a segment of small bowel 110mm in length with an adherent omental mass measuring 180 x 80 x 55mm.  The mucosa of the bowel appears flattened where the tumour is adherent.  The tumour does not appear to perforate through the bowel wall.  A separate adherent cystic mass is identified close to one of the bowel resection margins.  The cyst contains haemorrhagic mucoid material and has focal excrescences on its inner surface.  The cut surface of the omentum reveals multiple creamy soft tumours, the largest measuring 70 x 50 x 40mm.  \nBlocks:  1 - resection margins; 2 to 5 - further representative sections; 6 to 9 - furtherrepresentative sections of omental mass and nodules.   (LJ/mm 21 6.62) \nMICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr Y Enrique): \nA.   Sections of the ovarian tumour show that much of this is a high grade serous borderline tumour but in some areas the proliferation is very florid and the architecture is very complex, consistent with a component of low grade serous carcinoma.  The carcinoma is estimated to be around 40%of the tumour sampled.  The tumour consists of papillary structures and well formed glands lined by relatively uniform columnar epithelial cells with low grade nuclei.  There are auto-implants of serous borderline tumour on the surfaceof the ovary.  Sections of the fallopian tube show low grade serous carcinoma involving the fimbrial end and distending the distal tube; the tumour is polypoid, projecting into the tube lumen, and no invasion into the tube wall is seen.The tube elsewhere is unremarkable.  No high grade serous carcinoma is seen in the ovary or tube.  \nB.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable. Sections of the endometrium show that this inactive and shows some patchy pseudodecidual stromal change, consistent with exogenous hormone effect.  There are foci of adenomyosis and there are also leiomyomas in the myometrium.  The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.  There are scattered non-invasive implants of serous borderline tumour on the serosal surface of the posterior uterine wall and also focally on the anterior wall.  Sections of the fallopian tube are unremarkable.  Sections ofthe ovary show involvement by high grade serous borderline tumour and also some low grade serous carcinoma, similar in appearance to the tumour in specimen A.  The carcinoma is estimated to comprise around 20% of the tumour sampled.  There are auto-implants of serous borderline tumour on the surface of the ovary and also non-invasive implants focally on the serosa of the adjacent broad ligament.  \nC.  Sections show serous tumour which mainly has features low grade serous carcinoma.    \nD.  Sections show small bowel wall and adjacent omentum.  Multiple deposits of serous tumour are present in the omentum and involving the adjacent serosa of the small bowel.  There is minimal tumour involvement of part of the outer bowel wall but no involvement of the submucosa or mucosa is seen.\nIt is not possible cytologically to distinguish between implants of serous borderline tumour and metastases of low grade serous carcinoma but the volume of disease, especially in the omentum, would favour at least some of these tumour masses being metastases of low grade serous carcinoma.  \nRepresentative slides have also been viewed by Dr Y Bedward. \nDIAGNOSIS:  \nA.

Sections show a relatively circumscribed non-encapsulated fatty tumour intersected by fibromyxoid bands containing a hypocellular proliferation of spindle and stellate cells.  There is patchy admixed chronic inflammation including conspicuous plasma cells.  Numerous mast cells are also noted.  Scattered spindle and stellate cells display moderate nuclear atypia which may be degenerate in nature.  Occasional spindle cells display enlarged irregular hyperchromatic nuclei.  Occasionalganglion-like cells and multinucleated cells are seen although no classic floret cells are present.  No ropey collagen, plexiform vasculature, cellular areas or necrosis is seen.  Peripherally in areas there is a thin rim of skeletal muscle however, the tumour abuts the resection margin in several areas.\nImmunohistochemical stains demonstrate variable CD34 expression in the fibrous areas including the spindle cells. S100 stains the adipocytes while the spindle cells are negative.\nCOMMENT:\nThe differential diagnoses considered include a spindle cell lipoma with focal pleomorphic lipoma areas and well differentiated liposarcoma.  The features are not those of a neurofibroma.  In view of the location and overall appearances a diagnosis of spindle cell lipoma is favoured, however I cannot entirely exclude a well differentiated liposarcoma.

Hookwire is inserted from the medial aspect of the specimen aiming centrally.  Two very short stitches noted on the anterior surface.  Superior inked green, superficial inked blue, deep inked black.

(TO: EE;XR/ec 24.5.63) \n \nMICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr N Cills) \nThe specimen has been entirely embedded and examined.  Within slices five, there is a disrupted, diathermy affected papillary lesion, approximately 8mm in dimension. A diathermied incision line extends from the superficial surgical margin into the papilloma, making cytological assessment unreliable.  The lesion is composed of focally sclerosed fibrovascular cores associated with disrupted epithelial cells showing probable moderate epithelial hyperplasia.  Although the majority of epithelial cells appear to show staining with CK5/6, and P63 highlights scattered cells along the fibrovascular cores, suggesting a myoepithelial lining, interpretation may not be reliable due to the disrupted and diathermied nature of the lesion.  A small aggregate of cells do not show staining withCK5/6 or P63.  In areas the papilloma appears to be present at the superficial resection margin, however, as the specimen is disrupted, and inked has probably tracked into the space containing the papilloma, margin assessment is best assessed by the operative impression of clearance.  The superior margin appears about 1mm clear, the  inferior margin 5mm clear, the deep margin 7.5mm clear, the lateral margin about 8mm clear and the medial margin well clear.  \nAdjacent ducts show moderate to florid epithelial hyperplasia of usual type.  There are foci of columnar cell change without cytological atypia including foci apparently admixed with epithelial hyperplasia.  Foci of apocrine metaplasia are also present.  A pagetoid focus of atypical lobular hyperplasia isalso seen involving one duct (Block 6L2).  There is no evidence of invasive malignancy.\n\nShown to Dr N Shamblin.\n\nCOMMENT:\nA papillary lesion is identified, however, marked diathermy artefact and specimen disruption precludes further subclassification.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nLeft breast tissue (Hookwire guided excision):  \n-  Papillary lesion (see comment and text)\n-  Focus of atypical lobular hyperplasia\n-  Foci of moderate to florid epithelial hyperplasia of usual type.\n \n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 50U636510E\nMEDICALRECORD: 5076365.CAE\nPATIENT: RUSSETT, LEATHA\nIDNUM: 50U63651\nSTREET: Fair Oaks\nCITY: BURNIE\nSTATE: Queensland\nZIP: 3289\nDATE: 23/5/2010=>2010-05-23\nTIME: 21/03/2013 at 13:55=>2013-03-21T13:55\nDEPARTMENT: DARLING POINT\nHOSPITAL: KOOWEERUP REGIONAL HEALTH SERVICE\nDOCTOR: FERMIN MORGAN SIMLER\nDOCTOR: EE\nDOCTOR: XR\nDATE: 24.5.63=>2063-05-24\nDOCTOR: N Cills\nDOCTOR: N Shamblin\n"}]}

(TO: MP; UD/mm 6.6.63) \nMICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr R Bernon)\nA.  The entire specimen is embedded and examined.  Almost all the specimen comprises well differentiated liposarcoma which is mainly lipoma-like with some intervening sclerosing areas.  The tumour appears partly circumscribed with an overlying thin fibrous pseudocapsule. The lipoma-like areas show variation in adipocytes size, scattered hyperchromatic moderately pleomorphic nucleoli and easily identified lipoblasts.  The sclerosing areas comprise hypocellular fibrous bands containing atypical hyperchromatic stromal cells.  Skeletal muscle forms the deep margin of the specimen and sclerosing liposarcoma abuts but does not penetrate the muscle. Focally (A1) there is mild increase in cellularity of atypical stromal cell, across 8mm. This focus, which reaches the superior margin at the junction with the deep margin, is interpreted as mildly cellular sclerosing liposarcoma, however, a low grade dedifferentiated component cannot entirely be excluded.  Focally (A9) there is a 4mm focus of circumscribed mineralised lamellar bone surrounded by sclerosing and lipoma-like osteosarcoma. The interconnected bony trabeculae show foci of rimming by moderately pleomorphic hyperchromatic spindle cells and scattered atypical stromal cells are also present within the intertrabecular spaces.  The osteocytes within the trabeculae do not appear overtly atypical.  No parallel seams of woven bone or filigree osteoid are seen.  No high grade dedifferentiated tumour is seen.\nThere is widespread involvement of all surgical margins, apart from the deep margin, across a broad front.  Although a thin fibrous pseudocapsule covers most of the tumour (superficially, laterally and medially), the capsule contains atypical stromal cells consistent with sclerosingliposarcoma. There is intervening skeletal muscle between tumour and the deep margin with a minimal clearance of 0.5mm (A1), ,however, all the adjacent margins (superior, inferior, medial and lateral) are also involved close to the deepmargin. The focus of ossification (A9) is 5.6mm clear of the superficial margin and greater than 10mm from the other margins.\nCOMMENT:\nThere is a 4mm focus of ossification within the well differentiated liposarcoma.  This focus is favoured to represent heterotopic ossification, however, as it merges with sclerosing liposarcoma and there are atypical intertrabecular stromal cells and atypical spindle cells abutting the bone (? osteoblasts), I cannot exclude a microscopic focus of low grade osteosarcomatous dediffentiation.  No definite high grade dedifferentiation is seen.  In contrast the foci of ossification in the previous resction specimen (61K04161- 15,47), were grossly visible and showed either marked stromal atypia  in association with atypical mitoses or seams of osteoid in continuity with malignant osteoblasts, as opposed to lamellar bone seen currently.\nB.  Sections show fibroadipose tissue and skeletal muscle.  Focally there are fibrous bands with mild increase in stromal cellularity and possible mild nuclear atypia.  Although focal infiltration by sclerosing liposarcoma cannot be excluded these foci also show diathermy artefact which may account for the appearance.  The adjacent adipose tissue appears mature without significant variation in adipocyte sizeor nuclear atypia.  No lipoblasts are seen.  No dedifferentiated liposarcoma is seen.  \nC.  Sections show mature adipose tissue.  No capsule is identified. There are no atypical features. In the appropriate clinical context the appearance are consistent with a lipoma. \nD.  Sections show mature adipose tissue.  No capsule or peripheral skeletal muscle is identified. . In the appropriate clinical context the appearance are consistent with a lipoma. \n\nSelected slides shown to Dr R Remondini.\n\nDIAGNOSIS\nA. Pelvic side wall: \n-  Well differentiated liposarcoma with focus of ossification (see comment).\n-  Foci of low grade dedifferentiation cannot be excluded, including at the superior margin.\n-  Extends to margins over a broad front (see text).\n-  No convincing high grade dedifferentiation.\nB.

AE.  Please refer to attached diagrams.   \n(AF/cc  13/6/63) \n \nMICROSCOPIC(Reported by Dr J Kopischke): \nThe specimen has been entirely embedded and examined.  Sections show a 1.4mm focus of classic infiltrating lobular carcinoma (block 15), as well as at least six foci of consistent with microinvasive lobular carcinoma (measuring up to 1mm in maximum dimension)(blocks 8, 12 ,16 & 23) arising within an extensive 70mm field of intermediate and high grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), the later including both classic and pleomorphic subtypes.  The separate invasive carcinomas are distributed across 25mm.  The invasive carcinomas are too small for formal grading but appear intermediate grade (tubule =3, nuclei =2, mitoses =0).  No definite lymphovascular invasionis seen.  A couple of the microinvasive foci are only detected in deeper levels examined with a keratin immunostain (block 12).  No carcinoma cells are present in the sections examined (twice) with ER (1.4mm lesion), however, similar appearing microinvasive carcinoma is strongly positive.\nTwo of the three tumours detected grossly are foci of mass forming high grade DCIS/pleomorphic LCIS.  Within some of the affected lobules there is colocalisation of high grade DCIS and pleomorphic lobular carcinoma within the same duct space with confirmatory positive and negative staining with E cadherin respectively (block 15). These two mass forming areas are located towardsthe inferior and central parts of the specimen.  The third more superiorly placed nodule is in fact an intramammary lymph node (blocks 47 & 55) which shows no evidence of metastatic tumour in multiple levels examined or with a keratin immunostain.   \nThe pleomorphic LCIS shows some apocrine features, foci of comedonecrosis and microcalcifications.  The high grade DCIS is also associated with calcifications to a lesser extent.  Although the calcification is mainly associated with mass forming areas of in situ carcinoma all of the intervening slices also show dispersed foci of intermediate to high grade DCIS, often clinging type, which in most instances is unassociated with calcification.  There is also calcification associated with benign intraductal proliferations, mainly columnar cell alteration both with and without hyperplasia.  Some of the columnar cell foci showing superimposed architectural and cytological atypia amounting to atypical ductal hyperplasia.  Foci of flat epithelial atypia are also seen.\nA synoptic report for breast carcinoma follows (please note that ductal carcinoma in situ and pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ components are grouped together in the margin summary as are the multiple invasive carcinomas).   \n  \nInvasive carcinoma:\nSite: Left breast.\nType: Infiltrating lobular (classic type).  \nInvasive tumour size: 1.4mm (block 15) plus multiple separate foci of microinvasion (up to 1mm) (blocks 8, 12 &16)\nGrade (Modified Bloom & Richardson): probably 2 (for 1.4mm focus)\nTubules: 3     Nuclei: 2     Mitoses: 0 (insufficient fields)     \nLymphovascular invasion:  Not seen\n\t    \nDCIS or Pleomorphic LCIS:  \nDCIS:  present\nPleomorphic LCIS: present\nMaximum extent of DCIS: Approximately 70mm (all 15 slices)\nNuclear grade:  Intermediate to high\nArchitecture (DCIS): Cribriform, micropapillary and clinging\nNecrosis:  present\nCalcification: present (mainly in pleomorphic lobular component)\nExcision Margins:  \nInvasive component: (microinvasive and invasive foci)\nMedial - 1.4mm with intervening classic LCIS (block 8).  \nLateral (towards deep) - 2.2mm with intervening classic LCIS extending to the margin (block 15).  \nDeep towards lateral - 8mm (block 23)\nSuperficial, inferior, superior - well clear (>10mm)\nIn-situ component - (DCIS or pleomorphic LCIS) \nInferior -0.1mm (no intervening normal ducts) (block 1) \nIn situ component (cont.)\nLateral - 1.1mm (no intervening normal ducts) (block 11)\nMedial - 3.5mm (with intervening normal ducts) (block 16)\nSuperior - 5.2mm (with intervening normal ducts) (block 70)\nDeep - 3mm (with intervening normal ducts) (block 12)\nSuperficial - well clear (>10mm).\nReceptors (Blocks 15 & 16): \nER 1.4mm focus cut out (block 15); 95% strongly positive in small separate focus (block 16)\nPR:   positive (block 15)\n\t95% of nuclei stained\n\tpredominant intensity of staining: strong\nHER2 (Novocastra 10A7): 1+ (negative); no residual tumour tissue for CISH (block 15).

Attached to one of the strips of the peritoneum is subcutaneous fat, 40x35x35mm, with an ellipse of skin, 40x20mm, bearing an umbilicus, measuring 10x5mm. Multiple glistening nodules are seen covering the serosal surface of the right hemicolon, terminal ileum, peritoneum, and the mesocolic fat. A metastatic deposit is also seen, immediately deep to the umbilicus, 20x15x12mm. The skin itself is macroscopically unremarkable. On opening the large bowel and small bowel mucosa, appears unremarkable. No polyp is seen seen. No ulceration seen. ----the appendix, appendiceal opening is identified. No obvious appendix seen. At the location of the appendiceal opening, a glistening tumour is found which is partially cystic, 30x20mm in cross-section. The tumour extends to the surface of the caecum.\n\nInterim block description:\n(12 proximal ileal margin and distal large bowel margin; 13 ileocaecal valve and ileum with adherent tumour; 14&amp;amp;15 caecum with appendix insertion site; 16 caecum to posterior margin; 17 ascending colon, anterior serosa; 18 vascular pedicle with one bisected apical node; 19 four lymph nodes; 20 four lymph nodes; 21 one trisected lymph node; 22&amp;amp;23 one bisected lymph node each; 24&amp;amp;25 umbilicus with underlying tumour mass, composite block; 26 adherent strip of peritoneal tissue).\n\nNext part consists of a left hemicolon with the following components:\nTransverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid and rectum. 720mm in length with a variable diameter from 20mm-235mm; mesocolic and mesorectal fat, 260x80x50mm; adherent strips of peritoneal tissue, up to 210x80x20mm, covering the exposed serosa and the peritoneum and mesocolic fat are multiple mucinous tumours forming a cake-like mass, 140x80mm in area, with glistening tumours extend also onto the adherent peritoneum.

The lumen appears compressed externally by tumour masses.\n\n(27 proximal margin; 28 distal margin; 29 transverse colon; 30-----; 31 sigmoid colon; 32 vascular pedicle with two apical nodes; 33 distal vascular pedicle with one apical node; 34 four lymph nodes; 35 four lymph nodes; 36 tumour on surface of mesocolic fat; 37 tumour in adherent strips of peritoneum).\n\nMultiple additional strips of peritoneum with fat also present, 160x140x50mm in aggregate. The strips of peritoneum are covered in multiple mucinous tumours, up to 50x30x20mm.\n\n(38&amp;amp;39 sections from the separate pieces of peritoneum with fat). RS (M-39/ JC/cy)\n\nMICROSCOPIC:   (Dr. X Kuniyoshi)\nSections of gallbladder show mild changes of chronic cholecystitis.  Within the surrounding fat, there is extensive deposition of mucin associated with chronic inflammation.  Within the mucin pools, there are strips of mucin-secreting epithelium present showing low grade atypia. Extensive deposition of mucin is also seen within the omentum, associated with mucin-secreting epithelium showing low grade atypia.  The intervening stroma between the mucin pools shows chronic inflammation and fibrosis.\nFour lymph nodes are identified showing no evidence of metastatic tumour.\nSections show spleen show deposition of mucinous tumour on the capsular surface.  Within the splenic parenchyma, mucin pools with epithelium are also identified.  Mucinous tumour associated with abundant mucin pools is present adjacent to the pancreas.\nSections from the right hemicolectomy specimen show unremarkable small bowel mucosa.  Sections from the distal resection margin show serosal adhesions and subserosal deposition of mucin associated with mucin secreting epithelium with low grade atypia.  Mucin deposition associated with fibrosis and congestion is noted along the serosal surface of the colonic mucosa.  The ileocaecal valve shows pseudolipomatous change.  At the appendiceal orifice, the serosal surface of the bowel shows deposition of mucinous neoplasm.  There is tumour abutting muscularis propria, but does not appear to extend into the submucosa.  The appendiceal mucosa at the orifice shows reactive lymphoid follicles.\nThe tumour mass at the umbilicus shows deposition of mucin pool within the dermis.  Strips of atypical mucin secreting epithelium are noted within the mucin pools.  No evidence of metastatic tumour seen in 9 lymph nodes identified within the right hemicolon.\nThe left hemicolectomy specimen shows deposition of mucin and epithelium on the serosal surface of the colon at the distal resection margin.  Throughout the colon, deposition of mucinous epithelium of low and intermediate grade atypia is noted extending into the muscularis propria.  No evidence of malignancy is seen in 8 lymph nodes identified.\nComment:   Histology shows extensive involvement by mucinous tumour of predominantly  low grade atypia, consistent with the clinical appearance of pseudomyxoma peritonei.  There is involvement of the omentum, gallbladder serosa, spleen, umbilicus and colon, both right and left side.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nOMENTUM, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, RIGHT COLON -\n- LOW GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM INVOLVING OMENTUM, COLON, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER SEROSA AND UMBILICUS\n\n24/5/2067 nh\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 98I066223D\nMEDICALRECORD: 9830662\nHOSPITAL: CALOUNDRA HOSPITAL\nIDNUM: 98I06622\nIDNUM: 98I066223D\nPATIENT: BUANNO, ANGELO BERNARD\nDOCTOR: X Kuniyoshi\nDATE: 24/5/2067=>2067-05-24\n"}]}

Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right axillary nodal mass&amp;quot;, consists of an unorientated ellipse of skin, measuring 52 x 16mm to a depth of 40mm.  The underlying fatty tissue measures 62 x 55mm.  The overlying skin appears to have a possible linear incision/scar measuring 6mm.  Specimen inked blue.  The specimen is serially TS which reveals a pale firm mass measuring 44 x 20 x approximately 30mm.  The lesion appears to abut the deep and radial margins.  Blocks: 1 to 3 - composite sections, one TS showing closest margins.\n\nB.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right forearm nodule&amp;quot;, consists of an unorientated ellipse of skin measuring 48 x 23mm to a depth of up to 14mm.  The surface of the skin appears grossly unremarkable.  Cut margins inked blue.  There appears to be a pale, firm mass on the cut surface measuring 22 x 20 x 13mm.

Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Right arm tumour stitch at proximal&amp;quot;, consists of an oriented ellipse of skin with attached fatty tissue, with a suture at one pole designating the 12 o&amp;apos;clock pole, with the specimen measuring 120mm (12 to 6 o&amp;apos;clock) x 70mm (3 to 9 o&amp;apos;clock) to a depth of 55mm.  The ellipse of skin measures 104mm (12 to 6 o&amp;apos;clock) x 34mm (3 to 9 o&amp;apos;clock).  The skin appears unremarkable.  On the deep aspect there appears to be a pale grey fascial surface.

Sections are of skin extending to subcutis. The subcutis is expanded by a 44mm malignant sarcomatoid spindle cell tumour. The tumour deposit is highly cellular and consists of sheets of moderately pleomorphic spindled cells arranged in intersecting fascicles and storiform structures. The tumour cells have brightly eosinophilic myoid appearing cytoplasm. There are scattered highly atypical bizarre cells with markedly enlarged nuclei, some of which are binucleate. Mitoses are readily identified, including numerous atypical mitoses. Foci of insipient necrosis are also present. The overlying epidermis shows no significant abnormality. The tumour abuts the radial and deep margins over a broad front.\n\nB.  Sections are of skin extending to subcutis. The subcutis is expanded by a 22mm malignant spindle cell tumour. The tumour deposit is moderately to highly cellular and consists of sheets of mild to moderately pleomorphic spindled cells arranged in intersecting fascicles and storiform structures. The tumour cells have brightly eosinophilic myoid appearing cytoplasm. Mitoses are readily identified, including occasional atypical forms. No necrosis or anaplastic bizarre cells are seen. The overlying epidermis shows no significant abnormality. The tumour abuts the radial and deep margins focally.\n\nC.  Sections of the right arm tumour show a subcutaneous malignant myxoid sarcoma (myxofibrosarcoma; myxoid MFH). The tumour is moderately cellular and composed of malignant spindled to epithelioid cells arranged within discohesive sheets separated by variable amounts of myxoid stroma. The tumour cells show moderate to marked cytologic atypia with epithelioid, rhabdoid and spindled forms. Scattered anaplastic appearing tumour cells are seen. There are broad areas of tumour associated necrosis and mitoses are readily identified. The tumour infiltrates surrounding fibroadipose tissue and the margins are as follows:\n\nDeep margin: Less than 0.1mm (C1)\n12 o&amp;apos;clock margin: Present at margin (C9)\n3 o&amp;apos;clock margin: Focally abuts the margin (C3)\n6 o&amp;apos;clock margin: 0.25mm (C11)\n9 o&amp;apos;clock margin: Less than 0.1mm (C4)\nSkin surface: 0.25mm (C13).\n\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (B2 and C1):\nTumour cells positive for: CD10, CD68 (patchy), vimentin. Tumour cells negative for: AE1/AE3, SMA, SOX10, desmin, HMB45 and myogenin.\nA ki-67 immunoproliferative index is high.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nSimilar to the findings of the recent core biopsies (as reported by Professor Schirpke - see above), the right axilla and right forearm lesions are malignant spindle cell sarcomas, with features consistent with high grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas. The morphologies of the two lesions are similar, each showing some some cytoplasmic features suggestive of focal myoid differentiation and minimal myxoid stroma, whilst the right axilla tumour shows more significant cytologic atypia than the forearm tumour.\n\nThe separate and larger right arm tumour is a high grade myxofibrosarcoma (myxoid MFH) with the most significant cytologic atypia of all three tumours. Immunohistochemical stains performed on both the of the right forearm and right arm tumours are identical.\n\nOverall, the presence of three discrete right arm, right forearm and right axillary malignant spindle cell sarcomas (albeit with variable degrees of atypia and myxoid stroma), would be compatible with the clinical impression of in transit sarcoma.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.  Right axillary nodal mass: 44mm undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, present at margins.\n\nB.  Right forearm nodule: 22mm undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, present at margins.\n\nC.

Two separate pieces of small bowel with mesentery, one containing the ileocolic anastomosis. Multiple pieces of peritoneum and a piece of muscle.\n\nThe first piece of small bowel measures 950mm in length and up to 30mm in diameter with mesentery 900x40x30mm.  The serosa of the small bowel is rough and covered in multiple small nodules.  Largest is gelatinous in appearance measuring up to 15mm. Situated at the centre of the length of small bowel 450mm from the nearest resection margin, the serosa is disrupted over an area measuring 20mm x 10mm.  No obvious inflammation associated with this disruption.  On opening, the small bowel mucosa shows normal appearance with no lesions identified.  A side to side anastomosis between small bowel and small bowel is located 260mm from one of the margins.  The anastomosis appears intact and unremarkable in appearance.  The mesentery shows no lesion.\n\nThe second piece consists of an ileocolic anastomosis consisting of small bowel, 70mm in length, 30mm in diameter attached to large bowel, 50mm in length, 50mm in diameter with attached fat 70x25x30mm.  The serosa is rough and covered in adhesions.  No obvious rupture or tumour nodules at 60mm from the small bowel margin.  The small bowel mesentery shows two metastatic nodules.  First metastasis is completely gelatinous measuring up to 22mm.  The second metastasis is cystic, measuring up to 30mm.  The cystic lesion is adherent to the small bowel.\n\n(1-10  is from the long piece of small bowel [1  margins, 2&amp;amp;3  tumour nodule tumour banking block is in 2, 4&amp;amp;5  small bowel with roughened serosa, 6  disrupted serosa on small bowel, 7  small bowel to small bowel anastomosis, 8-10  mesentery vascular pedicle shave]; 11-14  is from the ileocolic anastomosis [11  margins, 12  anastomosis, 13&amp;amp;14  metastatic nodules x2 adherent to small bowel)\n\nPart 3 consists of a piece of muscle 40x25x20mm containing metastatic gelatinous tumour up to 20mm.

Wesselink)\nThe small bowel resection margins are unremarkable.  The serosa of the small bowel shows large pools of mucin which are lined by low grade mucinous epithelium with basal nuclei.  The epithelium has papilliform and flattened morphology.  There are also small nests of low grade mucinous epithelium floating within the mucin pools.  A granulomatous and inflammatory reaction with organising fibrosis is present within and adjacent to the mucin.  The mucin and epithelium dissect into the muscularis propria but do not involve the submucosa of the small bowel.  Fibrous adhesions are present on the small bowel serosa away from the mucinous areas.  Acute inflammation with fibrin is also present on the serosa consistent with acute peritonitis.  No perforation of the small bowel is identified.\n\nThe ileocolic anastomosis resection margins are unremarkable.  The small bowel mesentery is transected by mucin pools with surrounding fibrosis.  The pools are lined by mucinous epithelium which grows in a flattended and papilliform architecture.  There is reactive fibrosis and granulation tissue and chronic inflammation associated with the mucin.  Focally, the serosal surface is markedly disruptive with excessive granulation tissue, fibrin, acute inflammation and residual lining mucinous epithelium.  The epithelium fragments into nests which are confined to the inflammatory reaction and do not invade into the surrounding fibrous stroma.  This inflammatory process with associated low grade mucinous epithelium involves the muscularis propria, submucosa and focally involves the mucosa in what appears to be a small diverticulum (block 14).\n\nThe skeletal muscle fragment shows adjacent fibrous tissue which contains large mucin pools that are lined by low grade mucinous epithelium growing in a flat and papilliform architecture.  The peritoneal fragments are also lined by similar epithelium.\n\nThere is no high grade mucinous epithelium, no signet ring cells, and no invasive carcinoma.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nSMALL BOWEL PLUS PERITONEAL DISEASE:\n- LOW GRADE MUCINOUS CARCINOMA PERITONEI / DISSEMINATED PERITONEAL ADENOMUCINOSIS (DPAM)\n12/6/2067 km\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 30K749314W\nMEDICALRECORD: 3037493\nHOSPITAL: ANGLISS HOSPITAL\nIDNUM: 30K74931\nIDNUM: 30K749314W\nPATIENT: GRGUREVIC, BRODIE BRITT\nDOCTOR: I.

AE (1-1/MC/ank)\n\nMICROSCOPIC:   (Dr F Grassman)\nA. The ovarian tumour has been extensively sampled and sections show features in keeping with a borderline mucinous tumour. The tumour is multiloculated and lined by columnar mucin secreting epithelium with scattered goblet cells and mild to moderate atypia. There are foci of proliferation characterised by mild epithelial budding and tufting. There are no areas of high-grade nuclear cytology, and no areas of cribriform architecture. There are no features to suggest invasive malignancy. There are areas of necrosis and dystrophic calcification. Sections of the fallopian tube include small paratubal  serous cysts.\n\nThere is also extensive organising mucin on the surface of the ovary and the fallopian tube. No mucinous epithelium is identified within this mucin. The macroscopic defect of the ovarian surface described macroscopically is difficult to identify the sections. However, the extra-ovarian mucin is most likely of ovarian origin (via rupture). The sampled surface of the ovary shows no evidence of perforation by epithelial tumour.\n\nB. Sections of the left ovary show a unilocular serous cyst adenoma. There is no evidence of architectural or cytologic atypia. The residual ovarian stroma includes a number of small serous epithelial inclusion cyst. There is extensive organising mucin on the surface of the ovary, without mucinous epithelium and without evidence of ovarian cystic rupture.\n\nSections of the cervix are unremarkable. There is no evidence of squamous or glandular atypia. Sections of the endometrium show inactive morphology. Several leiomyomas are confirmed, together with patchy adenomyosis. There is also extensive organising mucin on the surface of the uterus without mucinous epithelium.\n\nC. Representative sections of the omentum confirm the macroscopic impression of foci of fat necrosis. As in Specimen A&amp;amp;B, there is extensive surface organising mucin without mucinous epithelium.\n\nD. Sections show one benign reactive lymph node. There is no evidence of malignancy.\n\nE.

RS (M-14/MC/km).\n\nMICROSCOPIC:   (Dr. Z Johansing)\nSections of stomach show that the submucosa is expanded by a low grade mucinous neoplasm which focally invades the muscularis propria.  The tumour is composed of pools of extracellular mucin within which are floating frequent strips and aggregates of neoplastic mucinous epithelium.  The neoplastic mucinous epithelium appears to be low grade, however, there are very focal signet ring cells present (block 6).  No desmoplastic stromal reaction is seen.  The overlying acid secreting mucosa appears unremarkable. Also present are serosal deposits of mucin and neoplastic low grade epithelium.  Focally, deposits of mucin and epithelium are seen within the serosa, at the distal excision margin (block 6).  Deposits of acellular mucin are also seen on the serosal surface towards the distal end of the specimen. At 15mm from the excision margin, there are deposits of mucin and neoplastic epithelium, and some of these deposits show features suggestive of lymphovascular involvement, (although this is difficult to differentiate from retraction artefact).\nThe first segment of small intestine described macroscopically shows a mucin filled cyst which replaces the muscularis propria and extends from the submucosa through to the serosa.  It is partially lined by low grade neoplastic mucinous epithelium. The excision margins of this segment of small intestine are free of tumour.\nThe second segment of small intestine shows a similar mucin filled cystic deposit within the serosa and muscularis propria which is also lined by low grade mucinous epithelium.  The excision margins of this segment of small intestine are also free of tumour. The small intestinal mucosa appears unremarkable.\nSections of fatty tissue (? peritoneum) show a deposit of low grade mucinous neoplasm, with adjacent extracellular mucin showing extensive dystrophic calcification.  The neoplastic mucinous epithelium has low grade nuclear features, and no desmoplastic stromal reaction or signet ring cells are seen.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nPARTIAL GASTRECTOMY PLUS SMALL BOWEL :\n-LOW GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM INVOLVING STOMACH, SMALL INTESTINE AND PERITONEUM.

The margins of resection are unremarkable. The separate largest piece of fibrofatty tissue contains several deposits of moderately differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma within a desmoplastic stroma. Necrosis and apoptotic debris are seen within some of these malignant glands. The features are in keeping with the clinical history metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma. This specimen also includes several encapsulated rounded nodules of unremarkable splenic tissue.\nSections of the other separate fibrofatty tissue pieces show that the largest nodule described macroscopically is a zone of inflammatory granulation tissue, suggestive of proximity to an abscess or area of inflammation. The smaller nodules are deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma within desmoplastic stroma. The nodule of inflammatory granulation tissue includes an area where fibrous tissue merges with striated muscle. A single lymph node in the fatty tissue shows mild reactive changes only.\nB. Sections of the liver show two deposits of moderately differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma, with a similar appearance to that in Specimen A. Each deposit has extensive central tumour necrosis. There is prominent tumour budding at the periphery of these deposits. One of these deposits is extremely close (0.1mm) to the diathermied excision margin, while the second deposit appears to focally involve this inked excision margin. The adjacent non-involved liver parenchyma appears unremarkable.\nC. Sections of liver show two deposits of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, similar to those in specimens A and B, both of which show extensive peripheral budding. One of these deposits is 0.5mm from the inked excision margin, while the other deposit focally involves the inked excision margin. Sections of the non-involved liver parenchyma appears unremarkable.\nD. Sections show an extensive, infiltrating deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma within fibrous tissue and adjacent striated muscle. No definite involvement of the diathermied excision margin is identified in the representative tissue examined.\nE. The largest nodule is an irregular deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma within desmoplastic stroma and fibrofatty tissue. No residual lymph node tissue is identified adjacent to this deposit. A separate small lymph node shows mild reactive changes only.\nF.

The posterior surface is ragged and includes a kidney 120x65x35 mm with attached ureter 140x4mm and adrenal gland 40x20x15 mm. The mass comprise lobules of firm yellow tumor with variable cut surface including white and firm areas, myxoid areas and bright yellow areas. There are also focal pearl like hard areas (? cartilaginous).  Tumor necrosis is present and comprises 25% of the cut surface. The tumour invades into renal sinus fat which has a pale cut surface and pushes the renal pelvis. It also invades into the adipose tissue adjacent to the adrenal gland. The fat lobules show pushing invasion of the the large bowel wall with no definite intraluminal involvement. The anterior surface is inked blue the posterior resection margin is inked black.\n\nReceived separately a right hemicolectomy specimen consisting of terminal ileum 60mm, caecum and ascending colon 80mm with attached mesentry and mesocolon up to 50mm.

RS (M-33/MY 2/2/2067 nh)\n\nMICROSCOPIC:   (Dr F Sundby)\nSections confirm the clinical diagnosis of liposarcoma.  The tumour has been extensively sampled, and the morphology varies from areas of well differentiated (lipoma-like) liposarcoma to areas of high grade sarcoma. These well differentiated and high grade areas are often intimately admixed. The morphology of the high grade areas varies from myxoid areas with admixed highly atypical often multinucleated stromal cells resembling high grade myxofibrosarcoma. Other areas are characterised by more fibrous to frankly sclerotic stoma containing numerous markedly atypical multinucleated cells with scattered mitotic acitviity (1 per 10hpf) and multi-vacoulated cytoplasm. Some of these multinucleated cells resemble floret cells (pleomorphic liposarcoma-like). Others have appearances suggestive of rhabdoid/myogenic differentiation (possible heterologous differentiation). There are areas of tumour necrosis.  A panel of immunostains show that the lipoblasts are positive for S100, and the pleomorphic cells in the de-differentiated components are positive for desmin.  Smooth muscle actin and CD34 highlight the vascular component of the tumour and cytokeratin Cam 5.2 is negative.\n\nIn most of the sections, the tumour is characterised by a circumscribed un-encapsulated edge.  Anteriorly, tumour abuts the peritoneal (mesothelial) surface as well forms the anterior non-peritonealized surgical margin with no intervening normal tissue.  Tumour also forms the posterior surgical margin in a number of sections with no intervening normal tissue.  The tumour focally infiltrates the outer muscularis propria of the encased segment of large bowel, but does not infiltrate mucosa or submucosa, and the mucosal resection margins of this segment are not involved.  The liposarcoma also partially encases the kidney without renal parenchymal involvement.\n\nSections of the kidney show very occasional sclerotic glomeruli and small hyalinised renal tubular foci suggestive of chronic pyelonephritis.  Sections of the renal pelvis and ureter are unremarkable. Sections of the ureteric and vascular kidney resection margins are unremarkable.\n\nSections of the appendix show fibrosis of the lumen at its tip. Sections of the small and large bowel resection margins from the right hemicolectomy component are unremarkable. Sections of the separately received length of small bowel show foci of serosal inflammation, but no evidence of malignancy.\n\nComment: In this site, an adipocytic tumour with well and poorly differentiated areas almost certainly represents a de-differentiated liposarcoma. Sections will be referred for MDM2 and CDK4 ISH and a further report will follow.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nRETROPERITONEAL TUMOUR -\n-  LIPOSARCOMA WITH BOTH WELL DEDIFFERENTIATED AND POORLY DIFFERENTIATED COMPONENTS, FAVOUR DE-DIFFERENTIATED LIPOSARCOMA.\n- TUMOUR FOCALLY ENCASES A SEGMENT OF LARGE BOWEL AND THE ANTERIOR ASPECT OF THE KIDNEY.\n-  CIRCUMSCRIBED UNENCAPSULATED TUMOUR MARGIN FORMING ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR SURGICAL MARGINS\n- ISH AND FURTHER REPORT TO FOLLOW.\n\n5/3/2068 nh\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 24/3/68\nPlease see separate report for MDM2 and CDK4 FISH both reported as &amp;quot;amplification DETECTED&amp;quot;.

CD10 and WT-1 are positive in the endometrial stromal component and  SMA is positive in the fibromatous areas.\nSections of the cervix are unremarkable.\nThe endometrium shows a nodular-polypoid appearance with adenomyosis and focal serosal endometriosis.\nIn addition, there is a well circumscribed nodule measuring 10mm in diameter with composition of endometrial stroma and with some nodular areas resembling smooth muscle. This involves the endometrium and with infiltration of the myometrium. In some areas there is interdigitation of endometrial stromal cells with myometrial smooth muscle. No unequivocal lymphatic space invasion is seen. There is less than 1 mitosis / 10hpf. No areas of necrosis or cytologic pleomorphism. The tumour invades 8mm in a myometrial thickness of 14mm.\nThe tumour has appearances of low grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (block A16). CD10 is positive in endometrial stroma cells and SMA and desmin are positive in cells with smooth muscle differentiation.\nB.  The section shows omentum in which small nodules composed of cellular plump spindled cells with intervening collagen are seen. These are positive for CD10 (focal, variable), and are negative for inhibin, calretinin, and SMA.\nComment: The appearances are those of low grade endometrial stromal sarcoma of the uterus with involvement of both ovaries and omentum (pT3).\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

Histology shows multiple areas of organising mature fibrosis associated with numerous calcified psammoma bodies and patchy inflammation consistent with chemotherapeutic response which are found predominantly over the serosa of the colon and adjacent pericolic fat and also focally over the capsule of spleen and serosa of the gallbladder. However, largely within the colonic disease are small residual islands of viable high grade serous carcinoma characterised by an acinar and solid architecture and high grade nuclear atypia surrounded by some inflammatory cells. Six local pericolic lymph nodes are identified which show no evidence of viable or tumour or chemotherapeutic effect. Small nodules of fibrosis consistent with chemotherapeutic effect are also seen within some pericolic fat and also in the hilum of the spleen and the possibility of replaced and therapeutically modified tumour deposits within a lymph node cannot be excluded.\n\nB. Within the liver, there is a large relatively cellular focus of metastatic high grade serous carcinoma with focal mucinous differentiation, which shows evidence of minor chemotherapeutic effect with small foci of coagulative necrosis and other areas of hyalinising fibrosis and inflammation.

Histology shows an endometrial adenocarcinoma with a villoglandular architecture with columnar cells which in places shows prominent hobnailing with some clear cells and increasing nuclear grade (2 to focal 3). On morphology the tumour shows some overlap between endometrioid and serous adenocarcinoma. Immunostains show focal patchy staining for p53 (ie wild type pattern), patchy p16, weak focal ER (5% 1+), focal minor staining for AMACR and negativity for WT1, p63. Ki67 is approximately 70%. Mismatch repair proteins are normal. This pattern of staining is more in-keeping with an endometrioid adenocarcinoma but due to the slightly ambiguous morphological appearances the tumour is best considered endometrial adenocarcinoma, NOS. Whilst there is minimal myometrial invasion, there are several foci of lymphatic vascular invasion in the immediately adjacent superficial myometrium. No malignancy is seen in 5 sentinel nodes (including IHC) and the omental biopsy is negative. However the peritoneal washings (reported separately 43C14326) contain numerous groups of malignant cells with similar morphology with numerous psammoma bodies present.\n\nENDOMETRIAL CARCINOMA:\n\nTumour type:  Endometrial adenocarcinoma, NOS\n\nFIGO grade:  2\n\n(architecture grade: 1 , nuclear grade: 2-focal 3 )\n\nMyometrial invasion: Very focally present\n\nDepth of myometrial invasion:   0.5mm\n\nMyometrial thickness:   15mm\n\n% of myometrium invaded:   1.6%\n\nFocality:  Unifocal\n\nTumour involves:  Fundus\n\nVascular/lymphatic invasion:  Present, several foci identified\n\nInvolvement of cervix:  Not present\n\nInvolvement of uterine serosa:  Not present\n\nExcision margins:  Clear\n\nNon-tumour uterus:\nAdjacent endometrium:  Atrophic\nPolyps:  Not identified\nAdenomyosis:  Minor focal\n\nAdnexae:\nLeft fallopian tube:  Not involved\nRight fallopian tube:  Not involved\nLeft ovary:  Not involved\nRight ovary:  Not involved\n\nLymph nodes:\nNodes involved:  0\nTotal number:   5 (2 right pelvic and 3 left pelvic)\n\nOther tissues:  The omental biopsy shows unremarkable fatty omental tissue with no evidence of malignancy.

The approximately 270mm tumour is a well differentiated liposarcoma with predominantly lipoma-like and focal sclerosing areas. The tumour is composed of adipocytes which show significant variation in cell size with scattered easily identified hyperchromatic enlarged nuclei as well as atypical stromal cells within fibrous septae.  A rare lipoblast is identified.  The tumour appears confined below the fascia with noinvolvement of the subcutis or dermis where there is scar tissue and suture granulomas evidencing previous surgery.  No de-differentiated areas or necrosis is seen.  The tumour infiltrates the small amount of striated muscle medially at the medial margin (block 21).  As is typically the case the margins are difficult to assess due to the scattered nature of atypical lipocytes , however lobules of fat containing these cells and showing cell size variation, extend to mostmargins across a broad front and are regarded as positive.

Sections of the macroscopically described polypoid and endophytic endometrial lesion show FIGO Grade 2 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma involves the outer half of the myometrium, 8mm of a total depth of myometrium of 12mm. There is focal lymphovascular invasion. In addition, there is a tumour deposit in the deep myometrium (A18) which is discontinuous from the invasive tumour front, and less than 0.5mm from the serosal surface. The deposit most likely arose in a focus of lymphatic spread, and has not been incorporated into the depth of invasion measurement.\n\nThe endometrial carcinoma is multifocal. A deposit of tumour in the lower uterine segment extends into the endocervical canal where there is glandular and stromal involvement. This involvement is prominent in the region of a lower uterine segment scar with foreign body suture granulomas, presumed site of LSCS. In the vicinity of the scar, the endometrial adenocarcinoma involves 3mm of the total depth of cervical wall of 6mm. Away from the scar, the maximum depth of involvement is 3mm add to a total of 14mm. The endometrial adenocarcinoma and the cervical involvement show similar immunoprofile for ER, CEA, p16 and Vimentin, and there is no identifiable cervical AIS or high-grade squamous dysplasia.The ectocervix is unremarkable. Bilateral parametrial tissue, ovaries and fallopian tubes are unremarkable. See synoptic report.\n\nB. Sections show benign adipose tissue. There is no evidence of malignancy.\n\nC.

Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left retroperitoneal mass plus left kidney, adrenal and colon&amp;quot;, consists of\na composite specimen weighing 4,950g.  The specimen measures 360mm (superior to inferior) x 220mm (medial to lateral) x up to 180mm (superficial to deep).  A segment of bowel is on the anterior aspect and measures 170mm long and the kidney with attached adrenal gland is identified posteriorly and measures 110 x 60 x 55mm in total.\n\nAn anterior mass of tumour (clinically ?dedifferentiated) measures 210 x 150 x 90mm.   The nodule is removed from the remainder of the specimen.  On sectioning, the anterior nodule has a multilobulated fatty appearance compromising approximately 40% necrosis.  Tumour extends to all margins.\n\nA 45mm solid nodule is identified arising within the mesentery of the attached bowel segment, separate from the main fatty posterior mass.  This nodule has discrete lobulated fatty cut surface with a peripheral rim of calcification and cystic change.\n\nIn the region near the ?inguinal canal there is a 25mm firm nodule abutting the deep margin.\n\nThe posterior mass otherwise has a multilobulated fatty appearance with no discrete areas of haemorrhage, necrosis or solid change.   Several possible lymph nodes are identified in a deep chain corresponding to position of aorta.\n\nInking Key\nThe anterior nodule is inked:\nAnterior = blue, posterior = purple, medial = red and lateral = green.\nThe remaining posterior mass is inked:\nAnterior = blue, posterior = black, medial = red, lateral = green, kidney hilum = yellow, ?inguinal canal attachment = yellow, residual tissue around detached anterior nodule = purple.\n\nBlocks: 1 to 14 - anterior nodule (1 and 2 - superior; 3 and 4 - anterior; 5 and 6 - medial; 7 and 8 - lateral; 9 and 10 - posterior; 11 and 12 - inferior; 13 and 14 - central tumour); 15 - renal hilar vessels; 16 - hilar lymph nodes; 17 - possible ureteric margin; 18 - proximal and distal bowel margins; 19 - shave of ?inguinal canal; 20 and 21 - superior adrenal and kidney with adjacent superior fat; 22 - renal hilum with hilar fat (medial); 23 - inferior kidney with adjacent perinephric fat/tumour; 24 to 26 - composite section through 45mm mesenteric nodule; 27 to 36 - posterior mass (27 and 28 - anterior margin; 29 and 30 - posterior/deep margin; 31 and 32 - medial margin; 33 and 34 - lateral margin; 35 and 36 - inferior margin); 37 - tumour with adjacent bowel wall; 38 - RS through 25mm ?inguinal canal nodule; 39 - one possible node; 40 - one node bisected; 41 - tumour for biobanking; 42 to 45 - remainder of nodule seen in 38;  46 - fibrous septae embedded en face; 47 to 51 - further RS of mottled fat ?mosaic type; 52 - tissue inferior to block 23.

Individual tumour nodules measure up to 60mm in maximum dimension and have a variable haemorrhagic and mucoid cut surface.  No definite necrosis is seen.  No solid areas are identified.  The testis (35mm) is still confined within the tunica albuginea.  The tunical sac is dilated by serous fluid.  The fatty tumour extends to the peripheral and deep margins, and separated only by a thin fibrous layer.  Please note, fibrous layer retracts during fixation and sectioning.\n\nInking Key:\nDeep = black, medial = red, lateral = blue.\n\nBlocks:  1 - TS shave spermatic cord margin/edge; 2 to 5 - composite section through spermatic cord superior to skin; 6 - superior skin with underlying tumour; 7 - deep margin with dense fatty nodule; 8 - medial skin and tumour; 9 - medial margin; 10 - deep margin; 11 - lateral margin; 12 - lateral skin with underlying tumour; 13 - further lateral margin; 14 - central tumour; 15 - tumour with adjacent testis; 16 - inferior margin with testis.

The tumour has large anterior and posterior macroscopic components. Overall, the tumour is predominantly a well differentiated liposarcoma with a lesser component of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (mosaic pattern). The well differentiated liposarcomatous component includes lipoma-like, sclerosing and inflammatory subtypes, and consists of lobules of atypical adipose tissue with variation in adipocyte size, conspicuous nuclear enlargement and hyperchromasia, scattered lipoblasts and variably prominent fibrous septae. The foci of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (mosaic type pattern) appear largely confined to the posterior component, and consists of expansile foci of undifferentiated high grade sarcoma admixed within areas of well differentiated liposarcoma.\n\nAnterior component:\nThe 210mm anterior nodule consists predominantly of lipoma-like liposarcoma with large areas of tumour necrosis.\n\nMargins of excision (anterior component): The well differentiated liposarcoma extends broadly to all surgical margins.\n\nPosterior component:\nThe 360mm posterior nodule consists predominantly of well differentiated liposarcoma (lipoma like, sclerosing and inflammatory types) with scattered admixed foci of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (mosaic pattern). Well differentiated liposarcoma abuts the renal capsule, infiltrates the subserosa of the attached bowel to abut the muscularis propria and interdigitates between, and encases, lymph nodes along the bed of the medial aorta. The parenchyma of the included colon, kidney, ureter and adrenal gland appear otherwise involved.\nThere is also a discrete 45mm mesenteric focus of organising fat necrosis with a calcified capsule containing foreign body type giant cells. There are scattered foci of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (mosaic pattern) consisting of discrete, infiltrative and expansile sclerotic nodules containing moderately cellular sheets of malignant pleomorphic, hyperchromatic sarcomatoid tumour cells and scattered islands of entrapped well differentiated liposarcoma. These individual foci represent a small component of this large liposarcoma (A23 and A28), with each individual focus up to 10mm, and arising in areas where there is an increased component of sclerosing type liposarcoma (A46 to A51).\n\nEight lymph nodes are identified (adjacent to the medial aortic bed at the posterior aspect), one of which shows extensive effacement by dedifferentiated liposarcoma (with areas of meningothelial-like whorls and variably sclerotic stroma). This is favoured to represent a metastatic deposit (1/8). At least two of the sample nodes also show direct involvement by well differentiated liposarcoma characterised by replacement of hilar adipose tissue by lipoma like liposarcoma.\n\nMargins of excision (posterior component):\nWell differentiated liposarcoma: extends broadly to all surgical margins.\nDedifferentiated liposarcoma (mosaic pattern):\n- Posterior margin: Less than 0.1mm (A45) (nodal deposit).\n- Lateral margin: 3.3mm (A34).\n- Anterior margin: 5.5mm (A28).\n- Medial margin, superior and inferior margin: clear of dedifferentiated liposarcoma.\n\nB.  Sections of the 170mm scrotal mass show a well differentiated liposarcoma. The tumour has a predominantly lipoma-like morphology, as well as, a lesser component of sclerosing-type, and surrounds and encases the testis. Other areas show variable myxoid stroma and cystic change.  A discrete 25mm nodule shows increased cellularity and greater cytologic atypia, including prominent floret-like giant cells, consistent with a focus of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (pleomorphic liposarcoma-like morphology). The liposarcoma tumour spares the overlying skin, separated from the dermocutaneous tissue by skeletal fibres of the detrusor muscle. The testis shows active spermatogenesis.\n\nMargins of excision:\nWell differentiated liposarcoma extends to the spermatic cord margin and broadly to peripheral (medial, lateral, superficial and deep) margins and is greater than 5mm from the inferior margin (in proximity to testis).\n\nDedifferented liposarcoma (pleomorphic liposarcoma like): Less than 0.1mm from the deep margin; less than 1mm from lateral margin; clear of remaining margins (&amp;gt;10mm).\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.  Left retroperitoneal mass: Well differentiated liposarcoma (present broadly at margins) with focal dedifferentiation (mosaic pattern), less than 0.1mm to posterior margin.\n\nB.  Left scrotal mass: 170mm Well differentiated liposarcoma (present broadly at margins) with 25mm focus of dedifferentiated liposarcoma (less than 0.1mm from deep and 1mm from lateral margins).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecimenReceivedDate\n2379-11-11 00:00:00\n\n\nLastName\nAntonio\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "DATE: 19990304=>1999-03-04\nHOSPITAL: YARRA RANGES HEALTH\nPATIENT: Scott\nIDNUM: 31Y903383U\nMEDICALRECORD: 3199033\nDOCTOR: J Signorile\nDATE: 19/8/69=>2069-08-19\nDOCTOR: J Zippe\nDOCTOR: J Springman\nTIME: 2379-11-11 00:00:00=>2379-11-11T00:00:00\nPATIENT: Antonio\n"}]}

The mass comprise lobules of firm yellow tumor with variable cut surface including white and firm areas, myxoid areas and bright yellow areas. There are also focal pearl like hard areas (? cartilaginous).  Tumor necrosis is present and comprises 25% of the cut surface. The tumour invades into renal sinus fat which has a pale cut surface and pushes the renal pelvis. It also invades into the adipose tissue adjacent to the adrenal gland. The fat lobules show pushing invasion of the the large bowel wall with no definite intraluminal involvement.

RS (M-33/MY 2/2/2067 nh)\n\nMICROSCOPIC:   (Dr Q Malatesta)\nSections confirm the clinical diagnosis of liposarcoma.  The tumour has been extensively sampled, and the morphology varies from areas of well differentiated (lipoma-like) liposarcoma to areas of high grade sarcoma. These well differentiated and high grade areas are often intimately admixed. The morphology of the high grade areas varies from myxoid areas with admixed highly atypical often multinucleated stromal cells resembling high grade myxofibrosarcoma. Other areas are characterised by more fibrous to frankly sclerotic stoma containing numerous markedly atypical multinucleated cells with scattered mitotic acitviity (1 per 10hpf) and multi-vacoulated cytoplasm. Some of these multinucleated cells resemble floret cells (pleomorphic liposarcoma-like). Others have appearances suggestive of rhabdoid/myogenic differentiation (possible heterologous differentiation). There are areas of tumour necrosis.  A panel of immunostains show that the lipoblasts are positive for S100, and the pleomorphic cells in the de-differentiated components are positive for desmin.  Smooth muscle actin and CD34 highlight the vascular component of the tumour and cytokeratin Cam 5.2 is negative.\n\nIn most of the sections, the tumour is characterised by a circumscribed un-encapsulated edge.  Anteriorly, tumour abuts the peritoneal (mesothelial) surface as well forms the anterior non-peritonealized surgical margin with no intervening normal tissue.  Tumour also forms the posterior surgical margin in a number of sections with no intervening normal tissue.  The tumour focally infiltrates the outer muscularis propria of the encased segment of large bowel, but does not infiltrate mucosa or submucosa, and the mucosal resection margins of this segment are not involved.  The liposarcoma also partially encases the kidney without renal parenchymal involvement.\n\nSections of the kidney show very occasional sclerotic glomeruli and small hyalinised renal tubular foci suggestive of chronic pyelonephritis.  Sections of the renal pelvis and ureter are unremarkable. Sections of the ureteric and vascular kidney resection margins are unremarkable.\n\nSections of the appendix show fibrosis of the lumen at its tip. Sections of the small and large bowel resection margins from the right hemicolectomy component are unremarkable. Sections of the separately received length of small bowel show foci of serosal inflammation, but no evidence of malignancy.\n\nComment: In this site, an adipocytic tumour with well and poorly differentiated areas almost certainly represents a de-differentiated liposarcoma. Sections will be referred for MDM2 and CDK4 ISH and a further report will follow.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nRETROPERITONEAL TUMOUR -\n-  LIPOSARCOMA WITH BOTH WELL DEDIFFERENTIATED AND POORLY DIFFERENTIATED COMPONENTS, FAVOUR DE-DIFFERENTIATED LIPOSARCOMA.\n- TUMOUR FOCALLY ENCASES A SEGMENT OF LARGE BOWEL AND THE ANTERIOR ASPECT OF THE KIDNEY.\n-  CIRCUMSCRIBED UNENCAPSULATED TUMOUR MARGIN FORMING ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR SURGICAL MARGINS\n- ISH AND FURTHER REPORT TO FOLLOW.\n\n3/5/2068 nh\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT 24/3/68\nPlease see separate report for MDM2 and CDK4 FISH both reported as &amp;quot;amplification DETECTED&amp;quot;.

It is difficult to properly grade the tumour due to minimal amount of neoplastic epithelium (less than 5%).  The presence of extensive fibrosis and numerous macrophages is suggestive of previous neoadjuvant therapy.  If the patient had received neoadjuvant therapy, please refer to previous biopsy for tumour grading.  The most likely primary site is peritoneum.  The right fallopian tube is another possibility.

IPMN.\n\n\nMACROSCOPIC:\nSpecimen labelled &amp;quot;Subtotal pancreatectomy&amp;quot;, consists of a distal pancreatectomy and piece of omentum.  The pancreas measures 147 x 50 x 50mm.  Near the resection margin is a cystic structure measuring 30 x 30 x 25mm with an intact and smooth outer surface.  The pancreas weighs 94g.  The cystic structure appears intact.  Stapled line is removed with the residual margin inked black.  The inferior splenic vessel impression is identified.  Anterior surface inked blue, posterior red, and superior green.  On sectioning the lesion at the head of the pancreas is filled with thin, mucoid and clear fluid and is unilocular.  The proximal 45mm of the pancreas is sectioned longitudinally with the remaining pancreatic tissue sectioned transversely.  The cystic structure has a capsule less than 1mm in thickness throughout with a smooth internal surface.  The proximal longitudinally sliced section is sliced into 7 slices, with the remaining distal pancreas serially sliced TS into slices 8 to 23.  Please refer to attached photograph for specimen.

The 30mm cystic tumour within the pancreas is an intrAduct papillary mucinous neoplasm  (IPMN) with low grade dysplasia.  The tumour is composed of cystically dilated spaces lined by flat or shallow papillary mucinous epithelium of gastric type.  The underlying wall is variably fibrous and no ovarian type stroma is identified. The epithelium is lined by cells with rounded elongated bland nuclei which is predominantly simple with focal pseudostratification and occasional small nucleoli.  Mitoses are not identified.  The tumour appears to expand the main pancreatic duct with extension into some smaller branch ducts (favour combined main duct with involvement of branch ducts).  There are some associated patchy acinar atrophy.  No invasive carcinoma is seen.\n\nSUMMARY PANCREATIC TUMOUR\n\nHistological tumour type:  Intraduct papillary mucinous neoplasm ( gastric type) with low grade dysplasia\n\nMicroscopic tumour sites:  Distal pancreas favour main duct with involvement of branch ducts (please correlate with preoperative imaging)\n\nMaximum tumour diameter:  30mm (gross measurement)\n\nMargins:  Stapled resection margin 3mm (block 5)\n\nSurfaces:\nIn some areas disruption of the specimen makes assessment difficult.

The gastric mucosa could represent heterotopic mucosa from the duodenum.  The tissue is extensively infiltrated by moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The carcinoma is composed of tubular and cribriform glands as well as some solid nests and cords of cells with moderate and focally highly pleomorphic nuclei, occasional eosinophilic nucleoli and eosinophilic cytoplasm.  There is associated sclerosed desmoplastic stroma.  One of the cores include atrophic pancreatic parenchyma with sparse residual islet cells and lobulocentric atrophic ducts and  contains relatively sparse infiltrating carcinoma.  The tissue surfaced by gastric and small bowel mucosa also contains muscularis which is infiltrated.  The carcinoma involves the duodenal mucosa and focally appears to reach the gastric type mucosa.  There is associated villous atrophy in the duodenal component.  No intraepithelial lymphocytosis is seen.  There is focal perineural invasion. A focus highly suspicious for lymphovascular invasion is also present.\nCOMMENT:\nThe morphology of the tumour, although not specific is consistent with a pancreaticobiliary primary.\n\nB.  Sections of gallbladder show chronic cholecystitis.  There is thickening of the gallbladder wall and patchy mild transmural chronic inflammation.  The specimen includes a portion of subcapsular hepatocellular parenchyma which shows canalicular cholestasis, highlighted with a Hall&amp;apos;s stain for bile.  Perls staining shows hepatocellular iron deposition through the lobules with a zone 1 and canalicular accentuation.  The iron deposition is grade 3/4 (Modified Scheuer grade) There is some ductular proliferation within the portal tracts unassociated with oedema or neutrophils, however this is difficult to interpret given the subcapsular nature of the sample.  There is no evidence of malignancy.  No lymph nodes identified.\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe canalicular choestasis presumably relates to intrapancreatic biliary obstruction. The presence of hepatocelluar iron deposition (grade 3/4) warrants further investigation.\n\n\nC.  Sections show mature adipose tissue.  There is no evidence of malignancy.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

The carcinoma is arranged in solid nests as well as occasional glandular structures, the latter highlighted on dPAS staining. The tumour cells display a predominantly monomorphic round to oval nuclei with inconspicuous nucleoli and eosinophilic cytoplasm with some areas of cytoplasmic vacuolation.  In some areas close to the liver capsule the tumour cells appear more squamoid with more abundant cytoplasm, more pleomorphic nuclei and possible occasional intercellular prickles.  No keratinisation is seen.  There is small and medium sized vessel vascular invasion which is highlighted on both CD31 and Orcein stain.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  \tGATA 3 (diffuse strong), CK7 (diffuse strong), TTF1 (patchy strong), p63 (strong almost diffuse) and CK5/6 (accentuated in squamoid areas).\nNegative:\tCK20, PAX8, PR, Her2 (1+), Synaptophysin, Chromogranin, CD56, Napsin A\nEquivocal:       ER, some minimal patchy possible weak nuclear staining in the context of stronger \t\t\t\t cytoplasmic staining.\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe features are those of a poorly differentiated carcinoma predominantly adenocarcinoma with some possible squamous differentiation.    In the context of a lesion obstructing the distal stomach this would appear to be the likely primary site, however, the immunoprofile (CK 7 positive, GATA 3 positive, ER essentially negative )  is not informative is separating the possibilities of either breast, gastric or pancreatic origin.The  TTF1 expression is likely aberrant given the clinical history, however, origin from a lung primary  also cannot entirely be excluded.\n\nThe morphology is similar to the poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma seen in the previous gastric biopsy, although  that tumour did not show squamoid features.  Although  the tumour in the  gastric biopsy did not show definite associated glandular dysplasia or intestinal metaplasia althe morphology there is entirely compatible with a gastric primary.     In initial large series GATA 3 expression, commonly seen in breast carcinoma,  was rare  (&amp;lt;10%) in gastric adenocarcinoma. However, a recent study reported strong expression in up to 44% of cases of gastric adenocarcinoma. GATA 3 expression may also be seen in pancreatic carcinoma.  Immunostains are performed on the gastric biopsy and the tumour shows the the same expression pattern as the liver metastasis, namely diffuse strong GATA3 and CK7 expression, a similar pattern of ER staining (non-specific cytoplasmic with equivocal weak nuclear) while CK20 is negative. If it is clinically important to exclude the possibility of breast carcinoma comparison with the morphology and hormone receptor status of the previous breast carcinoma  may be useful.  Further correlation with the imaging findings would be of interest.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nLiver biopsy:\n- Metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma with glandular and possible squamous differentiation.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 08I496320U\nMEDICALRECORD: 0834963\nHOSPITAL: SNOWTOWN HOSPITAL\nDATE: 2/3/67=>2067-03-02\nDOCTOR: B Mourino\nDOCTOR: B Gandolfo\nTIME: 2:23pm on 27/1/17=>2017-01-27T14:23\nDOCTOR: B Venible\n"}]}

Greater curvature stomach.  6/12 pre-op Glivec.\nMACROSCOPIC:\nSpecimen labelled &amp;quot;Recurrent gastric GIST&amp;quot;, consists of a cystic mass with a thickened area at one edge, with a stapled margin at one edge of the thickened area.  The specimen measures 110mm x 80mm x 70mm.  The serosal surface of the mass is partly smooth but has a few fragments of adherent fatty tissue.  The cyst contains dark brown fluid and the inner lining is flat.  The cyst wall is generally around 4mm thick but in the thickened area is up to 14mm thick.  The area of thickening measures 50mm x 20mm.\nBlocks: 1 to 20 - all of the thickened area including resection margin; 21 - RS of cyst wall; 22 to 25 - cyst wall with serosal fat (TO: LM;LM/vo 5.4.67).  Re-select - 26 to 29 - further sections (NL 8.4.67).\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr E Munkberg):\nSections of the described cyst-like structure show central necrotic debris and a lining of fibrous tissue and multi layered histiocytes, some of which are hemosiderin laden.  The cyst wall consists of fibrous and hyalinised tissue of rather low cellularity but with scattered patchy areas of moderate cellularity.  The cells in the cyst wall have spindle shaped nuclei and generally scant poorly defined cytoplasm and there is an associated mild, patchy infiltrate of histiocytes and other mixed chronic inflammatory cells.  The majority of the spindle cells stain c-kit (CD117) positive. Mitoses are very infrequent in this component.  The features are consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) showing moderate to marked treatment effect.\nNumerous sections have been examined and there is a single focus of markedly cellular tumour identified, 3mm diameter (block 20).  In this focus the cells have large atypical nuclei with one or more nucleoli and scant cytoplasm.  In this focus there are numerous mitoses, numbering up to ten per high power field.  This focus is away from excision margins and does not extend to the serosal surface, and stains c-kit positive.\nThe outer surface of the mass is irregular with some patchy adherent fat.  In many of the sections there is a layer of dense, poorly cellular fibrous tissue between the treated tumour and the adherent fat.  No significant infiltrative growth of tumour into overlying fat is seen.\nSections of the described thickened area show that this is stomach wall with overlying body type mucosa.  The mucosa is essentially unremarkable.  Dense hyalinised fibrous tissue consistent with treated tumour obliterates part of the muscularis propria and extends into submucosa, but the overlying mucosa is intact.\nA single small piece of adrenal cortex is noted within fat on the serosal surface of the mass focally (block 9); there is no tumour involvement of the adrenal cortex.\nThe whole area of attached stomach mucosa and wall has been blocked.  The staples had to be removed prior to sectioning of the tumour so it is difficult to assess the adequacy of excision.  However no definite treated tumour is seen at the resection margins of the adherent stomach wall as far as these can be assessed.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nRecurrent gastric GIST:  GIST showing moderate to marked treatment effect.  Single small residual focus of cellular mitotically active tumour identified, see text.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (18.4.67):\nThe proliferation index in the cellular tumour focus with a Ki-67 stain is around 20%.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 14A537447L\nMEDICALRECORD: 140537\nHOSPITAL: THE PRINCE CHARLES HOSPITAL\nDATE: 18.4.67=>2067-04-18\nDATE: 5.4.67=>2067-04-05\nDATE: 8.4.67=>2067-04-08\nDOCTOR: E Munkberg\nDATE: 18.4.67=>2067-04-18\n"}]}

The 80mm ovoid circumscribed lesion consists predominantly of a malignant hypercellular spindle cell tumour consistent with dedifferentiated liposarcoma. A larger, extensive well differentiated liposarcomatous component, consisting of mixed lipoma-like, sclerosing and inflammatory subtypes, infiltrates and replaces the adipose tissue surrounding the tumour mass, the kidney, adrenal gland, pancreas, as well as, adipose tissue at the splenic hilum. In areas, the sclerosing subtype shows moderately severe cytologic atypia. The dedifferentiated liposarcoma appears viable and there is no significant necrosis.\nThe renal parenchyma shows patchy nephrosclerosis. The pancreatic parenchyma (and margin) shows features of PAN-IN 1B with patchy chronic pancreatitis. The splenic and adrenal tissue parenchyma shows no significant abnormality.\nMARGINS:\nThere is widespread involvement of surgical margins by well differentiated liposarcoma. Well differentiated liposarcoma is also present at the pancreatic margin and perinephric fat margins. The ureteric and renal vascular margins show no diagnostic liposarcoma. Margins are detailed below:\n\nWell differentiated liposarcomatous component:\nPresent widely at surgical margins (including sclerosing and lipoma-like subtypes): including superior (4), superficial (17 &amp;amp; 18), lateral (19 &amp;amp; 20), deep (21 &amp;amp; 22) and medial (23 &amp;amp; 24).\nInferior margin: Clear of well differentiated liposarcoma.\nDedifferentiated liposarcoma component:\nSuperficial margin: 3.3mm (17).\nDeep margin: 5.5mm (21)\nLateral margin: 10mm (19)\nSuperior, inferior and medial margins: Clear (&amp;gt;10mm) (25 &amp;amp; 26)\nPancreatic margin:\nWell differentiated liposarcoma present.\nRenal vascular margins:\nNo evidence of tumour.\nUreteric margin:\nNo evidence of tumour.\nCOMMENT:\nThe retroperitoneal tumour is a dedifferentiated liposarcoma. There is an extensive well differentiated component, which largely encases the dedifferentiated component, right kidney, adrenal and pancreas, as well as, infiltrates splenic hilar fat. The dedifferentiated component appears clear of margins, while the well differentiated component shows widespread margin involvement (superior, superficial, lateral, deep and medial margins positive). The pancreatic margin shows focal PAN-IN 1B.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nRetroperitoneal tumour: Dedifferentiated liposarcoma (see comment).\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT: CYTOGENETICS (2.11.65)\nReport from BILLINGTON CENTRE, SYDNEY CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL&amp;apos;s Pathology, KAMBALDA:\nReported by CLIFFORD POTEAT, validated by Dr C Gantzler:\nSUMMARY:\nAbnormal hypodiploid karyotype with large marker chromosome.

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Bodamer):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr M Arostegui who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Vern comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

Distal pancreas oriented in person by surgical fellow.\nMACROSCOPIC:\nSpecimen labelled &amp;quot;Spleen distal pancreas omentum&amp;quot;, consists of an enlarged spleen (240 x 170 x 55mm; 1440g), separate distal pancreas (100 x 63 x 20mm), and separate omentum (350 x 110 x 30mm).  The anterior pancreas is inked blue, posterior pancreas is inked black, and the new pancreatic resection (staples removed) margin is inked red.  The splenic capsule is smooth and tan apart from a small area of pale grey capsular discoloration (no involvement of splenic parenchyma), 68 x 40mm.  The splenic parenchyma appears tan and relatively uniform, apart from two areas of possible haemorrhage, 28 x 22 x 30mm and 22 x 17 x 18mm.  Within the fibroadipose tissue at the splenic hilum, there is a small nodule of pancreatic tissue, 15 x 10 x 10mm.  The main pancreas is irregularly shaped, with an area of nodularity at the inferior-distal aspect (?tumour), 27 x 28 x 14mm.  On sectioning, this area of nodularity appears haemorrhagic.  The remaining pancreatic parenchyma is unremarkable.  The serosal surface of the omentum is smooth and shiny; lymph nodes or tumour are not identified.  Complete pancreas embedded.\nBlocks:  1 &amp;amp; 2 - pale grey splenic capsule; 3 - representative splenic capsule; 4 - representative splenic parenchyma; 5 - larger splenic nodule, ?haemorrhage; 6 - smaller splenic nodule, ?haemorrhage; 7 - splenic hilum pancreatic nodule; 8 to 10 - representative omentum; 11 - shave (4mm) pancreatic neck (staples removed prior to shave); 12 to 17 - pancreatic nodularity, ?tumour; 18 to 41 - remaining pancreas.  Please refer to block diagram.\n(JB/vo 8.5.67)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr D Gurnsey &amp;amp; registrar Dr D Pevy):\nSections of pancreas show an approximately 30mm grade 1 (low grade) neuroendocrine tumour located at the tip of the pancreatic tail.  The tumour is composed of relatively uniform cells with salt-and-pepper chromatin and finely granular eosinophilic-to-amphophilic cytoplasm, arranged in cords and nests.  No necrosis is identified.  There is less than one mitosis per ten high-power-fields; the Ki67 index is less than 2%.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is identified.  The tumour cells are positive for CD56, synaptophysin, and chromogranin.  The tumour abuts the anterior pancreatic surface, extends to the posterior pancreatic surface (diathermied), and is well clear of the pancreatic (body/neck) resection margin.  The nodule identified at the splenic hilum is confirmed to be pancreatic tissue; this is taken to represent the detached tail of the pancreas rather than a splenunculus.  The surrounding pancreatic parenchyma shows multiple scattered neuroendocrine microadenomas (tumourlets) each measuring up to 1mm in maximum dimension.  Two microadenomas are present at the surgical resection margin.\nThe spleen shows diffuse expansion of the red pulp by haematopoietic elements, including numerous megakaryocytes, consistent with the clinical history of myelofibrosis.  The macroscopically described area of splenic capsular discolouration corresponds to an area of capsular thickening/fibrosis.  The omentum shows no significant abnormality.  Two (2) peripancreatic lymph nodes are negative for tumour.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nSpleen, distal pancreas, and omentum:\n- 30mm grade 1 (low grade) neuroendocrine tumour of the pancreas\n- Abuts anterior pancreatic surface, extends to the posterior pancreatic surface, and is well clear of the pancreatic resection margin\n- Multiple neuroendocrine microadenomas\n- Two (2) negative peri-pancreatic lymph nodes\n- Splenic (extramedullary) haematopoiesis\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 10B938432P\nMEDICALRECORD: 1009384\nHOSPITAL: KINGAROY HOSPITAL & COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTRE\nDATE: 8.5.67=>2067-05-08\nDOCTOR: D Gurnsey\nDOCTOR: D Pevy\n"}]}

Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Whipple&amp;quot;, consists of a pancreatoduodenectomy specimen including a segment of small bowel (200mm length x 40mm circumference), distal stomach (35mm length x 107mm circumference), proximal pancreas (73 x 60 x 45mm), and peripancreatic/perigastric fibroadipose tissue (up to 110mm in width).  No gallbladder is included.  The pancreatic neck margin measures 27 x 20mm in area, with the main pancreatic duct probable to a depth of approximately 15mm.  At the superior aspect of the pancreatic neck margin, there is a fibrosed and dilated common bile duct, 20 x 14 x 14mm.  The main duodenal papillary is expanded by the presence of a metal stent (11mm diameter), which extends to the common bile duct.  The accessory duodenal papillary is not identified.  The gastric and small bowel mucosa is unremarkable.  Additionally, there is separate omentum, 170 x 120 x 25mm, and a separate segment of small bowel, 50 x 50 x 57mm.  The pancreatic portal vein margin is inked blue, SMA margin inked red, uncinate margin inked green, anterior surface is inked black, and posterior surface is inked black.  There is an incision at the anterior aspect of the pancreas.  The stomach and small bowel margins are inked blue.  The pancreas is sectioned from inferior to superior into seven slices.  The pancreatic parenchyma appears fibrosed, with patchy areas of presumed fat necrosis; a discrete tumour mass is not identified.  The metal stent is intimately associated with the surrounding tissue, making it impossible to remove.  The stent and directly adjacent tissue has been excised to enable tissue processing.  The ampulla of Vater is in pancreas slice four.  The separate omentum and small bowel are unremarkable.\nBlocks: 1 - LS stomach margin; 2 - LS small bowel margin; 3 - shave pancreatic neck margin; 4 - shave common bile duct neck margin; 5 and 6 - LS separate small bowel margins; 7 - TS longitudinal small bowel margin; 8 - representative separate small bowel; 9 to 11 - representative omentum; 12 - peripancreatic/perigastric lymph nodes as seen; 13 - slice one of pancreas (inferior); 14 - slice two of pancreas; 15 - slice three of pancreas; 16 - slice four of pancreas; 17 - slice five of pancreas; 18 - slice six of pancreas; 19 - slice seven of pancreas (superior) (blocks 16 to 19 - stent and surrounding tissue excised).\n\nB.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Small bowel resection&amp;quot;, consists of a segment of small bowel, 55mm in length by 50mm circumference.  There are three stapled surgical margins, one at each end and one running longitudinally along the specimen.  The serosal surface is dark grey and smooth.  The mucosa is unremarkable; no tumour is identified.  The stapled surgical margins are inked blue.\nBlocks: 1 - LS margin at one end; 2 - LS margin at other end; 3 - TS longitudinal margin; 4 - representative LS.   (TO: JB; JB/ta 8/5/67)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof B Boesch):\nA.  All of the pancreatic tissue has been blocked except for the intrapancreatic common bile duct (CBD), and the immediately adjacent periductular tissue.  These structures were intimately associated with, and adherent to, a metal biliary stent, which had to be excised to enable removal of the stent before tissue processing.  It is therefore unknown whether residual tumour was present within the small amount of tissue adherent to the stent. All other pancreatic tissue has been submitted for examination and deeper levels have been examined.\nThe pancreatic parenchyma shows extensive fibrosis and atrophy, which includes islet pseudohyperplasia.  Residual pancreatic ductules retain a lobular architecture.  Inflammation is not a prominent feature.\n\nIn some areas the fibrosis appears to be secondary to obstructive pancreatitis, but in other areas, the fibrosis is looser and associated with mast cells and occasional pigment laden macrophages, consistent with tumour bed.\n\nDirectly adjacent to the disrupted region of pancreas around the stent, there is a 5mm focus of round-to-angulated glandular elements within fibrous stroma (A17).  These glandular elements are lined by atypical cells with coarse and vesicular chromatin and clear-to-eosinophilic cytoplasm. Scattered mitoses are identified in this region, but there is no necrosis.  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is present.\nThis area is challenging to interpret and it is difficult to separate a small focus of residual, poorly preserved adenocarcinoma from distorted pancreatic ductules in a region of pancreatic atrophy and fibrosis. Overall, the features are consistent with residual, microscopic carcinoma.  This region is 7mm from the pancreatic portal vein margin, and is well clear (&amp;gt;10mm) from all other pancreatic margins and surfaces.\n\nThe extrapancreatic common bile duct margin shows extensive ulceration, granulation tissue, and fibrosis.  Reactive glandular changes are present in areas adjacent to ulceration.\nNo tumour is identified and the margin of the CBD is clear.  There is an associated mild mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate.\nThe gastric and small bowel margins are negative for tumour.\n\nThe pancreatic fibrosis appears to extend into peripancreatic soft tissue, and may partly represent the previous site of tumour (tumour bed).  No tumour is identified in six (6) peri-pancreatic lymph nodes (0/6).\n\nThe regression grade (taking into account the overall region of fibrosis and probable tumour bed) is consistent with grade 1 (moderate response) - Single cells or small groups of cancer cells.\n\nB.  Sections of small bowel show no significant abnormality.  The crypt-to-villus ratio is normal.  There is no significant inflammation.  Organisms are not identified.  There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy.\n\nA provisional result was discussed with Dr B Emond by A/Prof B Wheatcroft.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.  Whipple:\n- 5mm focus of glandular atypia (consistent with residual adenocarcinoma) in fibrous tissue adjacent to common bile duct, clear of margins\n- Extensive pancreatic fibrosis, which extends beyond pancreas, consistent with tumour bed\n- Six (6) negative peripancreatic lymph nodes\n- Intrapancreatic common bile duct not able to be examined (see above)\n\nB.

Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;12 o&amp;#8217;clock vaginal margin&amp;#8221; consists of a piece of pale grey tissue measuring 8 x 7 x 5mm.  AE 1 block (bisected).\nB.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Vulval and vaginal margin at wall, stitch at 6 o&amp;apos;clock&amp;#8221; consists of a ring of predominantly pale grey tissue measuring 48 x 24 x 7mm.  There is a suture marking 6 o&amp;apos;clock.  At the 12 o&amp;apos;clock aspect of the specimen is a full thickness defect repaired with a small suture.  The 12 o&amp;apos;clock aspect of the ring, from approximately 11 o&amp;apos;clock to 3 o&amp;apos;clock has a ragged appearance over an area of approximately 25 x 11mm.  The inner margin (presumed vaginal) is inked blue and the outer margin (presumed vulval) is inked black.  The specimen is sequentially sectioned in a clockwise fashion starting from 12 o&amp;apos;clock, with each block containing a single slice.\nBlocks:  1 (12 o&amp;apos;clock) to 21.  (TO: JB:  JB/mm 5.1.65)\nC.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Right vaginal margin&amp;#8221; consists of an irregularly shaped piece of pale grey tissue measuring 13 x 6 x 7mm.  AE 1 block (bisected).\n(TO: JB; JB/rt 5.1.65)\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Estrem):\nA.  Sections show mucosa surfaced by stratified squamous non keratinising epithelium with underlying fibrous stroma.  There is patchy stromal chronic inflammation.  No evidence of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VaIN) or invasive malignancy is seen.\nB.  The specimen is entirely embedded and examined.  The specimen is received with sutures repairing the clefted 12 o&amp;#8217;clock region of the specimen which is partially disrupted on sectioning.\nSections show vulval skin surfaced by stratified squamous keratinising epithelium with underlying appendages in the stroma.  The vulval skin is in continuity with extensively ulcerated vaginal mucosa surfaced by a relatively small amount of residual stratified squamous non-keratinising epithelium, underlying which is scar tissue and suture granulomas in the stroma, evidencing previous surgery here.  In areas the specimen extends down to subcutis/adipose tissue and there is also some striated muscle.  VIN 2 or 3 is present at 3 o&amp;#8217;clock (B6), 7 o&amp;#8217;clock and 8 o&amp;#8217;clock (B13 and B14) and extends to the 3 o&amp;#8217;clock and 8 o&amp;#8217;clock vulval margins (B6, B14). The VIN is highlighted with a P16 immunostain with full thickness intense immunoexpression.  Additionally, arising in association with VIN, there are two, probably contiguous, foci of invasive carcinoma at 7 and 8 o&amp;#8217;clock (B13 and B14) measuring up to 0.8mm across (B13 L1) x about 6mm wide (estimate based on presence in two consecutive blocks B13 and B14) x 0.6mm deep (B13 L1 and 2).  Distinction from hyperplastic VIN with extension down follicular epithelium is difficult here, however, given the associated stromal desmoplastic reaction, invasion is favoured.  Invasive carcinoma is 1.5mm clear of the closest vulval margin at 8 o&amp;#8217;clock (B14) and 4mm clear of the deep margin (B13 L1).   Assessment of clearance of dysplasia at the vaginal margin is difficult as much of the surface epithelium is ulcerated and replaced by inflamed granulation tissue, however, where intact squamous epithelium is present the margins appear clear of VaIN (see block B13).  No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.\nFocally there is an increase in bland junctional melanocytes arrayed singly along elongated rete which may represent a simple lentigo (B7)\n\nSelected slides seen in consultation with Dr I Fredricks who concurs.\nC.  Sections show mucosa surfaced by stratified squamous non keratinising epithelium with underlying fibrous stroma.  There is patchy stromal chronic inflammation and stromal fibrosis.

J Chin Oncol 2015; Oct 5).\nTEST DESCRIPTION:\nThis test profiles a broad range of somatic mutations from 5 common oncogenes (BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, KIT and NRAS) using OncoFOCUS with additional custom panel.  This multi-gene parallel profiling is intended to assist the selection of targeted therapies for cancer patients.  Mutation analysis is performed on DNA isolated from tumour tissue.  The relevant target regions are amplified in 2 multiplex PCR reactions followed by 12 multiplex extensions.  Any mutant allele is accurately identified by mass spectrometry.  Any reported mutation is called with high confidence (i.e. the proportion of a mutant allele is 10% or more).  This oncogene panel can detect over 300 mutations including the following clinically relevant mutations in the EGFR (NM_ 005228), KRAS (NM_004985), BRAF (NM_004333), KIT (NM_000222) and NRAS (NM_002524) genes.

If tumour cells represent less than 20% of the cells analysed the sensitivity of the assay may be reduced.\n&amp;#8226;\tAll PCR based molecular diagnostic tests are subject to a low risk of non-amplification of one allele due to primer binding site DNA variants.

There is a leiomyoma.\n4. The tumour has a predominant exophytic papillary/villoglandular morphology. In some areas there is a lower grade cytology however other  areas show higher grade cytology and focal necrosis with up to 18 mitoses per 10hpf. In view of the absent staining for p-53 these appearances are consistent with a diagnosis of high grade serous carcinoma.\n5.

Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Abdominal sarcoma&amp;#8221; consists of a solid mass with an orientating suture indicating antero-superior.  The tumour is 170mm (superior to inferior) x 140mm (medial to lateral) x 130mm (anterior to posterior).  The specimen weighs 1436g.  At the superior aspect of the tumour, adjacent to the orienting suture, there is attached adipose tissue, 65 x 35 x 15mm.  Over the inferior portion of the anterior surface is a roughened area, 60 x 50mm, corresponding to the area of the tumour adjacent to the bladder wall.  The remainder of the surface of the tumour appears smooth and intact.  The tumour margin adjacent to the bladder wall is inked blue.  The remainder of the anterior margin is inked black, posterior margin green, and superior margin red.  The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior into eight slices.  Slice one (superior) was subsequently sectioned in the sagittal plane from left to right into ten slices.  The area adjacent to the bladder wall is present in slices three to six.  Overall the cut surfaces have a gelatinous and fleshy tan appearance.  Within slices three to five is a central firm grey and haemorrhagic area, 40mm across, occupying less than &amp;lt;5% of the tumour.\nBlocks: 1 to 7 &amp;#8211; slice one superior margin (1 &amp;#8211; left side; 2 &amp;amp; 3 &amp;#8211; includes adjacent adipose tissue; 4 &amp;amp; 5 &amp;#8211; paired sections, includes adjacent adipose tissue; 6 &amp;#8211; haemorrhagic area; 7 &amp;#8211; right side); 8 &amp;amp; 9 &amp;#8211; slice two; 10 &amp;amp; 11 &amp;#8211; bladder margin slice three; 12 &amp;#8211; posterior margin slice three; 13 &amp;amp; 14 &amp;#8211; haemorrhagic area slice three; 15 &amp;#8211; haemorrhagic area slice four; 16 &amp;amp; 17 &amp;#8211; bladder margin slice four; 18 &amp;#8211; right lateral margin slice four; 19 &amp;amp; 20 &amp;#8211; bladder margin slice five; 21 &amp;#8211; posterior margin slice five; 22 to 24 &amp;#8211; haemorrhagic area slice five; 25 &amp;#8211; bladder margin slice six; 26 &amp;#8211; left lateral margin slice six; 27 &amp;#8211; right lateral margin slice six; 28 &amp;#8211; central tumour slice six; 29 &amp;#8211; posterior margin slice seven; 30 &amp;#8211; left lateral margin slice seven; 31 to 33 &amp;#8211; slice eight inferior margin.

Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left testicle and cord&amp;quot; consists of a testicle, 60 x 45 x 35mm, with attached spermatic cord, 85mm in length and 15mm across.  Midway along the spermatic cord is an attached solid mass, 70 x 50 x 55mm.  The specimen weighs 144g in total.  The tunica overlying the testis is smooth and intact, with a small amount of serous fluid between the layers of the tunica.  The testis is 35 x 35 x 25mm and appears normal.  The epididymis is 45 x 10 x 10mm.  The external surface of the spermatic cord mass appears smooth and intact.  The mass is well clear of the spermatic cord margin.  The cut surface of the spermatic cord mass has a multinodular pale yellow appearance.  Some of the nodules have a firmer consistency, affecting approximately 40% of cut surfaces.  No definite haemorrhage or necrosis is identified.  The external surface of the mass is inked black.\nBlocks:  1 - spermatic cord margin shave TS; 2 - TS spermatic cord adjacent to mass; 3 - spermatic cord adjacent to testis; 4 - testis and epididymis; 5 - superior part of testis; 6 - testicular hilum; 7 to 11 - firmer areas of tumour; 12 to 14 &amp;#8211; pale yellow areas of tumour.  Specimen photograph taken.  (TO: KT:  KT/mm 21.1.65)\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Z Cavallario):\nA.  The sections of the abdominal mass show a 170mm well-differentiated liposarcoma with a mixture of inflammatory and sclerosing morphology.  The majority of the tumour appears surrounded by a thin band of fibrous tissue.  Sclerotic fibrous septae extend through the tumour imparting a vague multinodular appearance.  The tumour contains prominent myxoid stroma with a lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate and scattered thin-walled blood vessels.  The tumour is generally hypocellular and shows atypical spindled to stellate cells embedded within myxoid stroma and bands of fibrous tissue.  These cells have enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei with occasional multinucleated forms.  Up to 2 mitoses per 10 HPF are identified.  The haemorrhagic areas noted macroscopically may correspond to the core biopsy site, and shows a slight increase in cellularity, aggregates of neutrophils and a small organising thrombus.  The tumour has been extensively sampled and no dedifferentiated component is identified.  No established tumour necrosis is seen.  No convincing lipoblasts are identified.\nIn the area identified as off the bladder wall there is a disc of adherent smooth muscle, consistent with detrusor muscle.  The tumour abuts the detrusor muscle over a broad front, however no definite detrusor muscle invasion is seen.  The tumour is clear of the inked bladder wall margin, however focally involves all other margins.  Within the inferior aspect of the tumour, there is a segment of entrapped vas deferens.\nB.  The sections of the 70mm spermatic cord mass show a well-differentiated liposarcoma with a mixture of inflammatory, sclerosing and lipoma-like morphology.  The tumour has areas composed of variably sized adipocytes with rare lipoblasts.  Other areas contain a dense lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate and areas of sclerotic fibrous tissue with scattered enlarged atypical hyperchromatic nuclei.  Mitoses are not readily identifiable.  No tumour necrosis is seen.  No dedifferentiated component is identified.\nThe main tumour mass extends to the inked surgical margin.  Atypical tumour cells are also seen extending throughout the length of the spermatic cord, as well as insidiously infiltrating into the epididymis, efferent ductules and tunica albuginea.\nAn incidental appendix epididymis is seen.  The testicular parenchyma shows no significant abnormality.\nRepresentative sections seen with Dr Z Keasey.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA &amp;amp; B.

There is a moderately to variable markedly cellular spindled to epithelioid/rhabdoid cell proliferation with scattered osteoclastic type and tumour giant cells. The cytoplasm is eosinophilic but no unequivocal striation is seen. There appears to be a variable abrupt transition from lower to widespread higher grade/pleomorphic areas (best seen in 6). The nuclei show variation in size with mostly intermediate to scattered marked pleomorphism. The nuclei are ovoid with irregular nuclear membranes, some coarse chromatin and some show distinct nucleoli. There are areas of more prominent thick collagen bundles in between the tumour, hyalinisation and coagulative and infarct type necrosis. Florid mitotic activity is seen (31mitoses/10HPF with field diameter 0.55mm) including some atypical forms. The scattered single more prominent atypical cells (up to 3 times the size of the average tumour cell combined with atypical mitoses and the small circumscribed area of increased atypia are best regarded a focal areas of anaplasia.\nThe peripheral 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin is best regarded as focally involved (3) at the level of subcutis and in another focus the 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin is less than 0.1mm away (6). The 3 o&amp;apos;clock peripheral margin is 4mm away.The deep margin is 1.6mm with an intact soft tissue plane (4). The other margins are further away.\nThe overlying skin shows moderate sun damage.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nThe tumour cells are diffusely positive for desmin (cytoplasmic). SMA shows patchy positive staining. Myogenin (nuclear) shows scattered single and small aggregates of positive cells. INI-1 shows retained nuclear staining. EMA shows scattered single cells with rather membranous staining. Pancytokeratin shows scattered small aggregates of staining\nThe tumour cells are negative for ERG, Sox10 and S100.\n\nThe morphological and immunohistochemical features show some similarity to the previous description in the core biopsy report from DHM. In the outside core biopsy Myogenin and Pancytokeratin were negative in contrast to the current excision however this may represent sampling.\n\nComment: The features are those of a rhabdomyosarcoma with some spindled areas including tumour giant cells and some sclerosis associated with focal anaplasia. The features are favoured to represent spindle cell/sclerosing type with patchy areas of pleomorphism over pleomorphic subtype.

Attached to a uterus measuring 60x40x30mm , the cervix measures measuring 30x25x20mm.  Multiple adhesions are identified at the posterior uterus where the bowel segment is adherent. These adhesions are obscuring the normal anatomy of the right and left adnexal structures.  The possible right fallopian tube measures 25x10mm attached to a cystic right ovary measuring 45x40x35mm.  The left fallopian tube is not clearly identified but the left ovary is forming a mass measuring 95x60x45mm occuping the posterior aspect of the uterus, the mesenteric adipose tissue and extends to approach the right ovary.   Multiple serosal nodularities are identified on the left ovary outer surface.The cut surface confirms a solid , papillary and partially cystic tumor likely arising from the left ovary invading the posterior uterine wall, the mesocolon and crossing the midline to reach the right adnexal structures. The cut surface of the right ovary is solid and cystic with soft papillary excrescences.  The majority of the tumour has central areas of necrosis and haemorrhage.  The tumor abutting the free serosal surfaces of right and left ovaries. The tumor and possibly abutting the mucosal surface of the bowel with no definite ulceration into the mucosa. The cut surface of the right fallopian tube is unremarkable. Even after serial slicing of the tumor are, the left fallopian is not identified and is possibly embedded within the solid tumour areas.

The serous carcinoma has papillary, micropapillary and solid growth pattern. There is a high mitotic rate with at least 80 mitoses per 10 hpf and there are atypical mitoses. Some areas of the tumour show an endometrioid carcinoma like glandular pattern but most is typical high grade serous carcinoma pattern. There is extensive involvement of fimbrial ends of fallopian tubes and assessment of STIC in this setting is difficult. In the presence of previous serous carcinoma in an endometrial polyp the tumour could be endometrial primary with intrabdominal spread but the strong WT1 staining although not definite would tend to favour fallopian tube primary with small drop metastasis to endometrium.

It measures up to 6mm in maximum dimension.\n\n(22 left fallopian tube includes parafimbrial cyst; 23 left ovary). RS (M-23/MC/ht).\n\nMICROSCOPIC:     (Dr. J Congleton)\nA.  Sections of liver show a nodule of moderately differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma.  The tumour shows glandular and cribriform architecture and extensive tumour necrosis.  Focal lymphovascular and possible vascular invasion is noted adjacent to the main nodule.  Tumour is 3mm from the inked resection margin.  Focal invasion into the overlying liver capsule is present.  There is also focal involvement of the capsular surface.  The liver away from the tumour nodule appears unremarkable. Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumour is positive for CDX2, and negative for CK7, CK20, Estrogen receptor and Progesterone receptor.\n\nIn addition, there is a 5mm separate nodule composed of hepatocytes with a relatively normal parenchymal architecture.  Within this nodule there are occasional small bile ducts, together with ductal metaplasia.  The liver plates within this nodule are up to 2 hepatocytes in width, there is no significant nuclear atypia and no increase in mitotic activity.  The overall features are suggestive of a small focus of focal nodular hyperplasia.\n\nThe macroscopically identified area of capsular roughening shows some surface inflammatory granulation tissue and fibrosis.  No viable tumour is seen in this area.  The underlying liver parenchyma shows an irregular area of fibrosis containing epitheloid granulomas, some of which shows small foci of central necrosis.  Special stains for bacteria, fungal elements and acid fast bacilli are negative within these granulomas.  No viable tumour is detected within this granulomatous inflammation.\n\nB.  Sections of gallbladder show features of mild chronic cholecystitis. There is no evidence of malignancy in the sections of gallbladder.\n\nSections of the spleen show several small subcapsular benign mesothelial cysts. The splenic parenchyma appears unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy in the representative tissue examined.\n\nSections of omentum show no evidence of malignancy. Two small omental lymph nodes are unremarkable.\n\nThe separate piece of tissue consistent with omentum shows surface papillary mesothelial hyperplasia.  There are no features to suggest mesothelial malignancy in this area.\n\nSections of uterus show a large deposit of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma within the posterior myometrium, predominantly within the outer myometrium.  This tumour extends 22mm trough a 33mm uterine wall, involving the outer half and part of the inner half of the myomehtrium. There is no obvious connection with the endometrium, which shows exogenous hormone effect with pseudodecidualised stroma and small atrophic glands.  No endometrial hyperplasia is identified.  The deposit of adenocarcinoma involves the serosal surface of the uterus.  Focal lymphovascular invasion is noted adjacent to this tumour.\n\nImmunohistochemical stain for CDX2 is strongly positive in this tumour, while Cytokeratin 7 shows focal positivity only. Cytokeratin 20, oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor are negative in this tumour deposit.The morphology and staining characteristics are similar to the tumour deposit in specimen A. The positivity for CDX2 in both tumours is supportive of a gastrointestinal primary site, although clinical correlation is recommended.\n\nElsewhere, the uterus shows adenomyosis. The cervix shows microglandular hyperplasia and numerous Nabothian follicles.  A mesothelial cyst is noted on the serosal surface of the uterus.\n\nSections of the right fallopian tube show a benign fimbrial cyst.  The fallopian tube is otherwise unremarkable.  The right ovary contains a luteinised follicular cyst, but shows no evidence of tumour.\n\nSections of the left fallopian tube and left ovary are unremarkable.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

(TO: RR;RR/vo 26.12.64)\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Stracener):\nA.  Sections show mature adipose tissue.  No investing capsule is seen.  There is no significant variation in adipocytes cell size and no lipoblasts or stromal cell atypia is seen.  The featuresare consistent with a lipoma.\nB.  The specimen has been extensively sampled.  Sections show skin to subcutis with deep fascia and a small amount of underlying striated muscle at the deep aspect.  Superficial to, but abutting the deep fascia, is an expansile partly circumscribed, partly infiltrative tumour composed of haphazardly arranged markedly  pleomorphic cells with hyperchromatic nuclei prominent eosinophilic nucleoli, occasional intranuclear inclusions, indistinct cell borders and cytoplasm.  Focally the tumour displays dispersed pleomorphic muitivacuolated lipoblasts with cytoplasmic vacuoles indenting atypical nuclei.  Bizarre forms and multinucleate giant cells are also present. The tumour shows varying cellularity withmoderate cellularity centrally and more hypocellular areas, particularly towards the circumscribed peripheral areas, where scattered tumour cells are seen within a fibrous pseudocapsule.  The stroma is collagenous with admixed chronic inflammatory cells and a component of relatively uniform short spindle cells and there are conspicuous dilated thin walled vessels are seen in one area.  Mitoses are easily identified including atypical forms.  There is no necrosis.  Although mostly circumscribed, in areas the tumour infiltrates adjacent fatty tissue and extends close to but does not invade the fascia.  The dermis is uninvolved.  The adjacent fat shows no significant variation in cell size and no lipoblasts are identified.\nThe margins are as follows:\n3 o&amp;apos;clock:  0.7mm (B13) with intervening fibroadpose tissue.\n9 o&amp;#8217;clock:  0.8   (B11) with intervening fibroadipose tissue.\nDeep:   2.1mm (B4) with intervening fibroadipose tissue and fascia.\nSuperficial:  10mm.\n12 o&amp;apos;clock and 6 o&amp;apos;clock:  Well clear (&amp;gt;10mm).\nThe morphology corresponds to that described in the original core biopsy report  (Healthscope Pathology lab no 43-8953778) in which no specific immunohistochemical line of differentiation or tumour mdm2 expression was identified.  The original biopsies were externally reviewed by Dr CLINT KUHNEN (JANDOWAE HOSPITAL Hospital) and by Dr M Wischmeyer (DENMARK HOSPITAL Hospital) both of whom favoured a diagnosis of pleomorphic liposarcoma.\nFurther immunostains on the current specimen, (INI1 and Myogenin) are  negative.\nCOMMENT:\nIn the context of the previouslyreported negative mdm2 immunoexpression, the features including the presence of pleomorphic lipoblasts strongly favour a diagnosis of pleomorphic liposarcoma.  FISH analysis, which is more sensitive and specific method to detect MDM2 alterations, will be performed at MUDGEE HEALTH SERVICE&amp;#8217;s Hospital and a supplementary report will be issued.  Although pleomorphic liposarcomas typically have a worse prognosis than other subtypes of liposarcoma, tumours located superficially may have a relatively better prognosis.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

Further sectioning of the omentum reveals disseminated firm white deposits (omental cake).\n\n(1 LS peripheral margin of bowel; 2 LS of other peripheral margin; 3&amp;amp;4 bowel wall with adjacent omental involvement; 5 three lymph nodes; 6-8 RS involved omentum).\n\nReceived a spleen with adherent fibrous tissue consistent with peritoneum and fibrofatty tissue with a total weight 303g. The spleen measures 170x95x40mm. The attached fibrous tissue measures 90x80x5mm and the fibrofatty tissue 100x50x35mm. The possible peritoneum is adherent to the splenic capsule and appears to be involved by minute (up to 2mm) white nodular deposits. Firm white area is also identified at the splenic capsule. The cut surface of spleen reveals red parenchyma with a single cyst measuring  35x25x25mm that has minute papillary excrescences over an area of 10mm. The remainder cut surface of the cyst is smooth and tan in colour. This cyst is located beneath the peritoneal adherent tissue. The cut surface of the adherent fatty tissue reveals firm white area measuring  10mm (tumour deposit).\n\n(9-11 RS splenic capsule with adjacent spleen tissue; 12 normal spleen tissue; 13 four LS peritoneal deposits; 14 firm white area in the adjacent fatty tissue).\n\nReceived a gallbladder measuring  60x30mm.

No calculi identified.\n\n(15 cystic duct and TS neck; 16 TS body and LS fundus).\n\nReceived multiple fibrous tissue consistent with peritoneum some of which is attached to pieces of possible muscle ?diaphragm with a total measurement of 190x180x50mm in aggregate. Multiple firm minute nodules are identified on all fragments.\n\n(17-19 RS peritoneal nodules; 20 tumour from omental cake block for tissue banking). RS (M-20/VN/ht).\n\nMICROSCOPIC:     (Dr I Bendavid)\nSections show moderately to poorly-differentiated high-grade adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows extensive involvement of the sampled omentum with adhesions to the surface of the spleen and the excised large bowel segment. There is also involvement of the peritoneum and diaphragm.\n\nThe adenocarcinoma is characterised by glandular, solid, micropapillary and single cell infiltration with focal signet ring cell morphology. The carcinoma is associated with extensive stromal desmoplasia. The cells are characterised by large pleomorphic nuclei with a central prominent nucleolus and relatively brisk mitotic activity, together with a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. There is relatively widespread tumour necrosis. A PAS stain with diastase suggestion shows patchy cytoplasmic mucin. There is no extracellular mucin. Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumour is positive for CK7 and PAX8 with focal positivity for CK20. There is focal positive staining for HBME-1, Calretinin and CK5/6. Tumour is negative for TTF-1, p53, WT1 and CDX-2.\n\nThe splenic parenchyma is unremarkable. The large bowel mucosa is unremarkable. Sections of the gallbladder show no convincing evidence of inflammation. There is patchy serosal congestion. Some of the peritoneal fragments include skeletal muscle suggestive of origin in the diaphragm.\n\nComment: The features are those of a high-grade moderately to poorly-differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma. The immunoprofile is consistent with but not specific for origin in the female genital tract. A pathology report from The Mater Laboratory Services, CENTRAL COAST, 3/9/2065, Lab # 3312C365716 documents mucinous carcinoma of the the left ovary, endometrium and fallopian tube with a very similar immunophenotype. The current appearances are consisitent with metastatic disease.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nOMENTUM, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, TRANSVERSE COLON, PERITONEAL AND DIAPHRAGMIC BIOPSY\n- WIDESPREAD METASTATIC MODERATELY TO POOLY-DIFFERENTIATED HIGH-GRADE ADENOCARCINOMA.\n- APPEARANCES OF IMMUNOPROFILE CONSISTENT WITH ORIGIN IN A FEMALE GENITAL TRACT.\n- METASTATIC DEPOSITS INVOLVING OMENTUM, PERITONEUM AND DIAPHRAGM WITH ADHESIONS DUE TO SEROSAL ASPECT OF THE TRANSVERSE COLON AND THE SPLENIC CAPSULE.\n\n10/9/2066 cy\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 33D213657D\nMEDICALRECORD: 33121365\nHOSPITAL: EAST GRAMPIANS HEALTH SERVICE - ARARAT\nIDNUM: 33D21365\nIDNUM: 33D213657D\nPATIENT: VERBASCO, ABRAHAM\nDOCTOR: VN\nDOCTOR: I Bendavid\nCITY: CENTRAL COAST\nDATE: 3/9/2065=>2065-09-03\nIDNUM: 3312C365716\nDATE: 10/9/2066=>2066-09-10\n"}]}

No calculi are identified.\n\n(1 cystic duct; 2 neck with overlying ragged serosal surface; 3 TS body and LS fundus).\n\nAn appendix measuring 55x10mm with attached mesoappendix and fatty tissue to a maximum width of 60mm. The serosal surface appears to be extensively involved by minute white deposits along with the peritoneal surface of the adjacent fatty tissue. This is causing adhesions and coiling of the appendix lumen. The appendix wall is thickened up to 4mm. Focal involvement of the overlying serosal deposits to the wall is identified at the body area. The lumen cut surface is unremarkable.\n\n(4 base [two LS and one TS]; 5 two TS mid; 6 tip [one LS and one TS]).\n\nReceived an ellipse of skin 75x30mm with underlying tissue to a depth of 50mm containing an umbilicus 20x5mm.

RS (M-19/ZH/ht).\n\nMICROSCOPIC:     (Dr. L Pescatore)\nAll of the tissue pieces examined show features of involvement by epithelioid malignant mesothelioma. The gallbladder shows mild chronic cholecystitis, together with serosal involvement by epitheloid mesothelioma. The mesothelioma shows tubular and papillary architecture in a desmoplastic and fibrotic stroma. The mesothelioma involves the serosal surface in multiple foci.\n\nSections of appendix also show multifocal involvement of the serosal surface by epithelioid malignant mesothelioma. There is focal minimal invasion into the underlying wall of appendix. There is no acute inflammation of the appendix. An incidental diverticulum of appendix is noted at the tip.\n\nSections of umbilicus show that the epidermis and dermis are unremarkable. The subcutaneous fatty tissue shows an irregular area of active fibrosis and fat necrosis, suggestive of previous surgery or trauma to the site. No involvement by mesothelioma is seen in the representative tissue from the umbilicus.\n\nRepresentative sections of omentum show multiple deposits of epithelioid mesothelioma on the surface of omentum, and focally invading into the underlying adipose tissue, with chronic inflammation. Focal possible lymphovascular invasion is seen. No spindle cell or sarcomatoid component is identified.\n\nAll of the sampled fragments of peritoneum show involvement by epithelioid mesothelioma, largely on the peritoneal surface, but including focal invasion into the underlying fat.\n\nImmunohistochemical stains (Block 11 from the omentum) show positive staining for Calretinin, HBME-1, WT1, EMA and Cam 5.2. Immunohistochemical stains for TTF-1, CEA, BEREP4, HERA and CD15 are negative.

There is a lobulated and somewhat circumscribed cellular tumour centred in the subcutaneous fat. The tumour focally bulges into deep dermis. The superficial dermis, epidermis and skeletal muscle are uninvolved. The tumour is composed of compact fascicles of plump spindle cells with moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and one to two nucleoli. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen and focally number up to 4 per 10 HPF. Necrosis is not identified. There are moderate numbers of admixed inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils within the tumour. The tumour also shows nodular areas of hyalinisation and myxoid change associated with foamy histiocytes and haemosiderin laden macrophages. These alteration is regarded as treatment related changes and is seen in approximately 60% of the tumour. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.\n\nThe tumour cells show the following immunoprofile:\n-  Positive:  EMA.\n-  Equivocal:  S100 (scattered tumour cells, no more than 5%) and Melan A (faint cytoplasmic staining in around 1% of tumour cells).\n-  Negative:  MNF116, Cam5.2, CK5/6, SOX10, HMB45, MUM1, CD34, SMA, desmin, myogenin, STAT6, MUC4 and ALK.\nNuclear expression of H3K37m3 is retained.\nThe Ki-67 proliferation index is up to around 10% at hotspots by visual estimation.\n\nThe overall features are those of a malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.\n\nThe cellular tumour mass itself is 1 mm from the deep margin (Block 14). However, the tissue deep to the tumour has a paucicellular and loose myxoid appearance in which there are interspersed atypical cells . These cells may represent reactive atypia in benign stromal cells although tumour cells with treatment effect can show a similar cytology and as such, definite clearance of tumour at the deep margin cannot be guaranteed. This loose myxoid change is present at the deep margin over at least a 5 mm front (Blocks 13, 14 &amp;amp; 15). The tumour mass and deep loose myxoid stromal change are &amp;gt; 10 mm from all peripheral margins.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nExcision of lesion, right forearm (post radiotherapy):  Malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with treatment effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecimenReceivedDate\n2737-09-03 00:00:00\n\n\nLastName\nWellons\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "DATE: 19940518=>1994-05-18\nHOSPITAL: GOWER WILSON MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE\nPATIENT: Newton\nIDNUM: 55N495880L\nMEDICALRECORD: 5554958\nPATIENT: Andreas\nDATE: 29/10/71=>2071-10-29\nDOCTOR: O Kahl\nTIME: 2737-09-03 00:00:00=>2737-09-03T00:00:00\nPATIENT: Wellons\n"}]}

Specimen is sectioned from proximal to distal into nine slices.  There is a lobulated tan tumour 55 x 45 x 25mm.  The tumour is 22mm from the 3 o&amp;apos;clock margin, 25mm from the 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin and abuts the deep margin.  30% of the tumour is possibly necrotic and there are areas of myxoid change.

See diagram.  (TO:YL/ec 29/10/71)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr L Kurokawa):\nSections show skin excised to include subcutaneous fat plus a small amount of underlying skeletal muscle. There is a lobulated and somewhat circumscribed cellular tumour centred in the subcutaneous fat. The tumour focally bulges into deep dermis. The superficial dermis, epidermis and skeletal muscle are uninvolved. The tumour is composed of compact fascicles of plump spindle cells with moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and one to two nucleoli. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen and focally number up to 4 per 10 HPF. Necrosis is not identified. There are moderate numbers of admixed inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils within the tumour. The tumour also shows nodular areas of hyalinisation and myxoid change associated with foamy histiocytes and haemosiderin laden macrophages. These alteration is regarded as treatment related changes and is seen in approximately 60% of the tumour. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.\n\nThe tumour cells show the following immunoprofile:\n-  Positive:  EMA.\n-  Equivocal:  S100 (scattered tumour cells, no more than 5%) and Melan A (faint cytoplasmic staining in around 1% of tumour cells).\n-  Negative:  MNF116, Cam5.2, CK5/6, SOX10, HMB45, MUM1, CD34, SMA, desmin, myogenin, STAT6, MUC4 and ALK.\nNuclear expression of H3K37m3 is retained.\nThe Ki-67 proliferation index is up to around 10% at hotspots by visual estimation.\n\nThe overall features are those of a malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.\n\nThe cellular tumour mass itself is 1 mm from the deep margin (Block 14). However, the tissue deep to the tumour has a paucicellular and loose myxoid appearance in which there are interspersed atypical cells .

There is a moderately to variable markedly cellular spindled to epithelioid/rhabdoid cell proliferation with scattered osteoclastic type and tumour giant cells. The cytoplasm is eosinophilic but no unequivocal striation is seen. There appears to be a variable abrupt transition from lower to widespread higher grade/pleomorphic areas (best seen in 6). The nuclei show variation in size with mostly intermediate to scattered marked pleomorphism. The nuclei are ovoid with irregular nuclear membranes, some coarse chromatin and some show distinct nucleoli. There are areas of more prominent thick collagen bundles in between the tumour, hyalinisation and coagulative and infarct type necrosis. Florid mitotic activity is seen (31mitoses/10HPF with field diameter 0.55mm) including some atypical forms. The scattered single more prominent atypical cells (up to 3 times the size of the average tumour cell combined with atypical mitoses and the small circumscribed area of increased atypia are best regarded a focal areas of anaplasia.\nThe peripheral 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin is best regarded as focally involved (3) at the level of subcutis and in another focus the 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin is less than 0.1mm away (6). The 3 o&amp;apos;clock peripheral margin is 4mm away.The deep margin is 1.6mm with an intact soft tissue plane (4). The other margins are further away.\nThe overlying skin shows moderate sun damage.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nThe tumour cells are diffusely positive for desmin (cytoplasmic). SMA shows patchy positive staining. Myogenin (nuclear) shows scattered single and small aggregates of positive cells. INI-1 shows retained nuclear staining. EMA shows scattered single cells with rather membranous staining. Pancytokeratin shows scattered small aggregates of staining\nThe tumour cells are negative for ERG, Sox10 and S100.\n\nThe morphological and immunohistochemical features show some similarity to the previous description in the core biopsy report from DHM. In the outside core biopsy Myogenin and Pancytokeratin were negative in contrast to the current excision however this may represent sampling.\n\nComment: The features are those of a rhabdomyosarcoma with some spindled areas including tumour giant cells and some sclerosis associated with focal anaplasia. The features are favoured to represent spindle cell/sclerosing type with patchy areas of pleomorphism over pleomorphic subtype.

The mesocolon/retroperitoneum shows widespread Well differentiated Liposarcoma.\n\nThe tumour is present throughout the blocks and shows mostly a lipomatous differentiation and smaller foci of sclerosing subtype (A43) and myxoid appearance. The tumour comprises predominantly adipose tissue with some areas showing fibrous septae. There are atypical nuclei in the adipose tissue including variation in size of adipocytes and septae including focal single multinucleated bizarre cells.. Lipoblasts are easily identified. There is abrupt transition to myxoid nodules (as seen macroscopically) and slow transition of more myxoid stroma. There are distinct nodules of sclerosing subtype (as seen macroscopically as nodules). Mitoses are very inconspiciuous. Small foci of fat necrosis are seen but there is no coagulative/tumour necrosis. There is no lymphovascular and no perineural invasion. The tumour extends to the stroma external to the muscularis propria of the colon in Specimen A but does not invade the muscularis propria. The stromal margins are involved and the colonic peripheral margins clear.

Sections of the cervix show some atrophic features and reactive epithelial changes.\nThe endometrium shows a polypoid lesion with overlying epithelial layer with underlying stroma that is cellular and with cytologic pleomorphism and mitotic activity. Scattered multinucleated giant cells are also seen. The appearances are those of adenosarcoma. The sarcoma appears to confine to polyp and the endometrium without evidence of myometrial invasion in the sections examined. Elsewhere with the myometrium, there are benign leiomyomas and adenomyosis. There is endometriosis with serosal adhesions and mesothelial rection with haemorrhage in the posterior uterine serosa/pouch of douglas.\n\nSections of the ovaries show serous cyst adenofibroma/serous inclusion with surface serosal adhesions and associated haemorrhage and macrophages reaction and with serosal endometriosis. The fallopian tubes are unremarkable.\n\nSections of the separate fragments of tissue consist of predominantly necrotic tumour including some fragments with a focal phyllodes-like growth pattern. There is a predominant stromal component (sarcomatous overgrowth). Some glands with columnar epithelium and with squamous metaplasia are identified. The stroma shows cytologic pleomorphism and increased cellularity with some subepithelial condensation. Multinucleated tumour giant cells are seen.

Right Pelvic Sidewall:\nSections show fatty connective tissue with an overlying layer of peritoneal mesothelium. The subsurface tissue is extensively involved by an infiltrative malignancy which has a predominantly cystic pseudoglandular architecture. The spaces are lined by large epithelial cells with moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei. The nuclei show variable atypia. There are some papillary structures present. In intervening stromal tissue there is a patchy chronic inflammatory infiltrate and there are some aggregates of foam cells. There are moderate numbers of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes. The subsurface epithelial proliferation merges with overlying mesothelial cells. Some cells contain cytoplasmic vacuoles.\n\nThe histologic features are consistent with MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA.\nSee specimen G for Immunohistochemistry.\nThere is deep invasion of subsurface fat by mesothelioma.\n\nB. Uterus, Bilateral Tubes And Ovaries:\n- Ectocervical mucosa is normal. Endocervical mucosa is normal. The endometrium is inactive and there is focal inactive adenomyosis present. There is a small intramural leiomyoma. The serosal/peritoneal surface of the uterus shows no abnormality.\n- The right ovary has some surface fibrous adhesions and small microcalcifications within granulation tissue. There is reactive mesothelial hyperplasia.\n- The right fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.\n- The left ovary shows areas of surface reactive mesothelial hyperplasia, and some small surface fibrous adhesions and granulation tissue. Within the granulation tissue, there are embedded aggregates of psammoma bodies.\n- The left fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.\nTumour is not identified in this specimen.\n\nC. Right Diaphragmatic Wall:\nSections show fatty subperitoneal tissue with a surface layer of peritoneal mesothelium. There is a subsurface partly solid and partly cystic mass with a papillary, solid and pseudoglandular architecture of similar appearance to the tumour in specimen A (MESOTHELIOMA). The subsurface lesion has an invasive growth pattern and involves much of the specimen. The cells have a variable decidoid appearance. There is a stromal inflammatory infiltrate of small lymphocytes in areas and some xanthoma cells. Some psammoma bodies are present. There are moderate numbers of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes.  The tumour invades some attached skeletal muscle in one  section (C7). There is overlying mesothelial hyperplasia, fibrous adhesions and areas of granulation tissue and in some areas there are aggregates of psammoma bodies.\n\nD. Omentum:\nThe omental tissue contains deposits of MESOTHELIOMA.\n\nE. Appendices Epiploicae:\nSections show fatty tissue with MESOTHELIOMA. There are also some aggregates of foamy histiocytes and cholesterol crystals and moderate numbers of psammomatous calcifications.\n\nF. Left Pelvic Sidewall:\nSections show subperitoneal fatty tissue with subsurface involvement by MESOTHELIOMA.\nThere is deep invasion of subsurface fat.\n\nG. Left Anterior Abdominal Wall:\nSections show fatty tissue with involvement by MESOTHELIOMA. There is deep invasion of subsurface fat. There are some sheets of foamy histiocytes associated with the tumour and a patchy chronic inflammatory infiltrate of small lymphocytes and plasma cells. The tumour cells have a decidual appearance.\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (IHC), block G2\nOther suitable block for testing: A2\nPositive: WT1, Podoplanin (D2-40), calretinin, CK5/6 (all 3+ positive)\nNegative: CD31, MOC-31, CEA, PAX8, ER, TTF1, CEA.\nBAP1: Immunohistochemical loss of nuclear staining\n\nCOMMENT on IHC:\nThe Immunohistochemical profile is consistent with mesothelioma. Immunohistochemical loss of nuclear BRCA-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a highly specific marker of malignancy in mesothelial lesions. In the current case there are other diagnostic features of malignancy (in particular deep invasion of subsurface tisssues).\n\nOTHER STAINS:\nDPAS: negative (section G2)\n\nSUMMARY OF TUMOUR FEATURES (all deposits):\nTumour type:\n- Diffuse malignant mesothelioma, epithelioid type.\n\nSize of largest tumour nodule:\n- 80x80x40mm (right diaphragmatic wall)\n\nExtent of invasion:\n- Invasion into subsurface fat (at least 20mm depth). Focal invasion of skeletal muscle in right diaphragmatic wall specimen (?focal diaphragm invasion)\n\nMitotic count:\n- 1 per 10 high power fields\n\nMargins:\n- Not applicable, but tumour involves margins of some pieces.\n\nStaging:\n- I am unaware of an agreed formal staging system for peritoneal mesothelioma.\n\nOTHER COMMENT(S):\n- There are moderate numbers of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in most areas of the tumour.\n- MMRP deficiency is rare in mesothelioma and has not been tested.\n- Tumour tissue is retained if testing for other biomarkers is required.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA,C,D,E,F,G.

In some areas there is a lower grade cytology however other  areas show higher grade cytology and focal necrosis with up to 18 mitoses per 10hpf. In view of the absent staining for p-53 these appearances are consistent with a diagnosis of high grade serous carcinoma.\n5.

If previous testicular tumour is a germ cell tumour may represent treatment effect with mature teratoma. Discussed with the surgical reg. Previous orchidectomy performed in New Zealand 15yrs ago.\nResult phoned to Surgical registrar by Dr J Stencel and Dr J Sacks at 12:15 on 12/1/21.\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr J Ernspiker):\nA. Paraffin embedded sections show fibrocollagenous tissue with patchy chronic inflammation and fat necrosis containing scattered islands of mature cartilage. A simple mucin lined ductule is also seen. In the clinical context of previous testicular tumour this is favoured to represent a focus of residual mature teratoma with treatment effect/fibrosis. There is no evidence of malignant germ cell tumour or sarcoma.\n\nB. Sections show aorta with surrounding peri-aortic tissue. There is extensive involvement of the fibrotic periaortic soft tissue by an infiltrative malignant sarcomatoid tumour. In the blocks submitted, the overall estimated maximum tumour dimension is 22mm (however, tumour is present at the margin and total tumour extent cannot be determined). The tumour is composed of malignant spindled to epithelioid cells arranged in dense cellular infiltrative sheets which dissect through periaortic fibrocollagen. In areas, the tumour cells appear to form malignant, anastomosing vascular channels lined by malignant hobnailed endothelial cells. The vasoformative tumour abuts and infiltrates into the adventitia and outer media of the aorta. Mitoses are readily identified and there are scattered foci of tumour necrosis. The tumour shows extensive crush type artefact and multifocal perineural involvement. The tumour extends broadly to the edges of the excision.\n\nFive lymph nodes are identified, one of which shows direct infiltration by tumour (1/5).\n\nImmunohistochemistry demonstrates positivity for vascular markers ERG, CD31 and CD34, as well as, BCL-2 (patchy), synaptophysin (weak),  Additional stains for inhibin, myogenin, LCA, WT1 (cytoplasm staining only), PLAP, AFP, desmin, tdt, pancytokeratin, CD56, SMA, TLE-1, MIC-2, CAM5.2, SOX-10 and OCT-34 are negative. INI-1 shows preserved (normal) nuclear staining.\n\nIn addition, within the surrounding fibrocollagenous and adipose tissue, there are occasional foci of cartilage on a background of broad nodules and sheets of dense organised fibrosis with  superimposed dystrophic calcification, fat necrosis and inflammation. Several entrapped medium to large nerves and ganglia are also seen. These background changes are suggestive of focal residual mature teratoma on a background of previous treatment related effect.\n\nC. Section show fibrocollagenous and adipose tissue showing fibrosis with superimposed patchy chronic inflammation and fat necrosis. No cartilage is seen. There is no evidence of malignancy.\n\nD. Sections show fibrocollagenous and adipose tissue showing fibrosis with superimposed patchy chronic inflammation and fat necrosis. A 1.1mm focus of adrenal cortical parenchyma, as well as, seven reactive appearing lymph nodes (0/7). No cartilage is seen. There is no evidence of malignancy.\n\nE. Section show fibrocollagenous and adipose tissue showing fibrosis with superimposed patchy chronic inflammation and fat necrosis. A single reactive lymph node is seen. No cartilage is identified. There is no evidence of malignancy.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe presence of islands of residual mature cartilage associated with organising fibrosis, inflammation, dystrophic calcification and fat necrosis in specimens A and B (para caval and peri aortic masses), is highly suggestive of residual mature teratoma on a background of treatment associated change. No evidence of malignant germ cell elements are seen.\n\nAs reported in the previous biopsy by Professor Jaussen, there is an associated peri-aortic high grade malignant sarcoma, which may represent: (a) malignant transformation arising within the previously treated para-aortic tumour; (b) or, a de novo sarcoma. In these specimens, the high grade sarcoma demonstrates malignant vasoformative morphology, as well as, strong diffuse staining with endothelial markers, consistent with a high grade angiosarcoma.\nSarcoma is present at margins.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA. Para-caval mass: Favour residual mature teratoma with treatment effects. No evidence of malignant germ cell tumour, sarcoma or malignancy.\n\nB. Peri-aortic tumour:\n- Malignant vasoformative tumour, consistent with high grade angiosarcoma, present at margins.\n- One of five lymph nodes shows direct invasion by angiosarcoma.\n- Background nodular organised fibrosis and dystrophic calcification ?treatment related change.\n\nC.

Sections show dense fibrous tissue, a small amount of fibroadipose connective tissue and a small focus of ovarian tissue. In areas the fibrous tissue is surfaced mesothelium and there is patchy surface mesothelial surface reaction, subserosal fibrosis associated and subacute haemorrhage in the form of hemosiderin laden macrophages. A small focus of subserosal tumour is present (A7, A8). The tumour is composed of epitheloid cells with moderately pleomorphic round to oval nuclei, mostly conspicuous nucleoli and a small to moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumour cells are arranged in a loosely cohesive aggregates associated with an infiltrative small lymphocytes. Gland formation and slit- like architecture is not seen. The morphological appearance is similar to those seen in the remaining specimens.\n\nB. Sections of uterus show a focus of subserosal high grade serous carcinoma involving the subserosa of the anterior uterine body (B1). The morphology as described previously.

The tumour consists of infiltrative sheets of poorly differentiated malignant cells with variable epithelioid to spindled morphology. The epithelioid appearing tumour cells have mild to moderate amounts of eosinophilic (focally rhabdoid) cytoplasm. The tumour cell nuclei appear epithelioid to spindled with moderate pleomorphism, round to angulated irregular nuclear membranes and hyperchromasia. Nuclei overlap and touch in areas. In block A16, a focus of markedly atypical bizarre epithelioid tumour cells is seen. Mitoses are readily identified throughout and there are broad sheets and serpiginous foci of tumour necrosis and haemorrhage (with focal dystrophic calcification and scattered cholesterol clefts). Tumour sheets appear separated by variably thick fibrous septae and whilst there are infiltrative foci that extend directly into adipose tissue, much of the tumour deposit appears surrounded by a fibrous pseudocapsule. Whilst the tumour deposit is a presumed lymph node metastasis, underlying nodal tissue is essentially completely effaced. Tumour is at least 0.45mm from the surgical margin (A19). The overlying skin shows no significant abnormality. One separate lymph node shows effacement by necrosis (without involvement by tumour) and eighteen additional lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/18).\n\nImmunohistochemical stains were performed and the results are as follows:\nTumour cells positive for: CAM5.2 (perinuclear dot like), desmin (perinuclear dot like), CD56, BCL-6\nTumour cells negative for: S100, SOX10, synaptophysin, STAT6, CK20, chromogranin, MITF, MIC2, SMA, LCA, CD34, HMB45, MelanA and BCL-6.\nA ki-67 is high (greater than 80%).\nAdditional stains performed in 2070 not repeated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe 80mm left axillary tumour is a deposit of metastatic (high grade) poorly differentiated malignancy.\n\nThe previous history is noted:\n- 2002: External slides reviewed at CONDOBOLIN RETIREMENT VILLAGE (ZM-64-317032) of right upper arm subcutaneous lump which was diagnosed as a monophasic synovial sarcoma.\n- 2013: Skin lesion excised from back and the tissue is examined at HAWKER MEMORIAL HOSPITAL (ZM-64-317032). A diagnosis of superficial spreading melanoma (Breslow thickness 0.5 mm, Clark level III) with a predominance of naevoid cells was made.\n- 2017: Subtotal colectomy at TOTTENHAM HOSPITAL (94P43170) for caecal adenocarcinoma, pT3 N1a Mx R0.\n- 2018: Liver segmental resection at LONG JETTY HEALTH CARE FACILITY (94P43170) for metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary.\n- 2020: Left axillary and right femoral reaming biopsies: Poorly differentiated malignancy with necrosis; variable cytokeratin, SOX10, S100 positivity; SSYT negative - favour metastatic melanoma, cannot exclude metastatic sarcoma or sarcomatoid carcinoma.\n\nThe previous left axillary and right femoral reaming biopsies have been reviewed and show overlapping histopathologic features and morphologic similarity to the current 80mm left axillary lesion. Whilst no demonstrable SOX10 or S100 staining is seen in this current excision, there is persisting positive cytokeratin, desmin and CD56 staining. BRAF, CK14, GFAP and K3K27me3 remain outstanding (other stains performed in 2070 have not been repeated).\n\nOverall, the 80mm left axillary deposit is a poorly differentiated high grade malignancy. Whilst there are similarities in morphology between the recently reported left axillary biopsy, femoral reaming biopsy and this current left axillary excision, there are some differences in the overall pattern of immunohistochemical staining in the tumours, making definitive classification difficult. However, following intra-departmental review, an overall pathologic differential diagnosis is thought to include: a dedifferentiated malignant melanoma; poorly differentiated carcinoma/neuroendocrine carcinoma; poorly differentiated myoepithelial carcinoma, as well as, a malignant sarcomatoid tumour (eg. MPNST). Given that classification of this tumour is difficult and there remains some uncertainy, the case (and previous biopsies from 2070) will be sent to Professor DYLAN RASHID for an additional opinion.\n\nB. Sections of the three level three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/3).\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA. Left axillary dissection:\n- 80mm deposit of poorly differentiated malignancy (difficult to subclassify and sent for additional opinion from Professor Pat).\n- One additional lymph node effaced by necrosis only and 18 reactive appearing lymph nodes.\n- Margin appears clear of tumour (0.45mm).\n\nB.

The tumour is composed of bland spindle cells surrounded by abundant myxoid stroma.  The slender spindle cells are relatively uniform with no significant cytological atypia or mitotic activity.  The cellularity of lesion is relatively evenly distributed and the cellularity appears to be higher than usual myxoma.  The periphery is slightly more cellular with collagenized capsule.  At periphery, the tumour infiltrates into the surrounding striated muscle.  No lipoblasts are seen.  There is scant blood vessels.  The matrix is slightly basophilic matrix with a few mucinous cysts.  The spindle cells are positive for CD34 and Vimentin.  The stains for S100, SOX10, EMA, SMA, Desmin, Myogenin, MUC4 and ALK are negative.  The overall appearances are consistent with those of intramuscular myxoma.  Because of the increased cellularity, the tumour is best to be classified as a cellular myxoma.  The tumour is completely excised.  In several locations, the tumour is separated from the resection margin by a thin layer of fibrous tissue.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nRight gluteal tumour - Cellular myxoma (intramuscular).\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 52L452761P\nMEDICALRECORD: 5244527\nHOSPITAL: BOOROWA MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE HOSPITAL\nDOCTOR: N Lindow\nDATE: 5/4/71=>2071-05-04\nDOCTOR: N Dellasciucca\n"}]}

The oriented excision of markedly sun damaged skin to subcutis and skeletal muscle shows residual incompletely excised High grade sarcoma adjacent to a scar.\n\nThe tumour is located mostly in the deep aspect of the specimen tracking within the skeletal muscle and deep to the subcutis within fascia like dense fibrous tissue and focally extends into the dermis.\n\nThere is a variable appearance of the tumour. In most areas there is a more exansile circumscribed high grade component. It is moderate to marked cellular with a spindled to epithelioid appearance. The nuclear are irregular in shape, hyprochromatic and without any nucleoli. Mitoses including atypical forms are easily identified (38 mitoses/10HPF). There are widespread intermixed osteoclastic-type giant cells, haemorrhage and hemosiderophages in between the atypical tumour cells. Some geographic necrosis is present.\n\nThere is also a more low grade component lacking the osteoclastic giant cells and comprises more mildly to moderately atypical single spindle cells (13, 16 -22, 25).These neoplastic atypical cells track widely beyond the expansile high grade nodules along the fibrous septa. Focal haemosiderin is associated with it.\n\nThe morpholgy is similar to the previous excision (00I57282). At that time the tumour showed also a heterogeneous appearance. In the current excision there are also occasional mildly atypical stromal cells which at times are difficult to distinguish between neoplastic and reactive due to adjuvant therapy. No immunohistochemistry has been repeated.\n\nThere is no lymphovascular invasion and a couple of nerves are overrun, however no convincing perineural invasion is seen.\n\nThe high grade component with the multinucleated giant cell extends broadly towards the deep margin in numerous sections examined including up to the edge to the 9 o&amp;apos;clock peripheral margin (9).

(TO:DN/ta 27/5/71)\nMICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr I Taub &amp;amp; Dr I Boerger)\nSections of the 170mm left posterior arm lesion show a malignant spindle cell sarcoma. The tumour has a predominant pushing advancing edge with a variably thick fibrous pseudocapsule. There is a surrounding cuff of mature fibradipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The tumour is moderately to highly cellular and is composed of malignant plump to anaplastic spindled cells arranged in herringbone and peritheliomatous patterns. At the centre of the lesion, there is extensive suppurative necrosis (with up to 85% of tumour appearing necrotic). Up to 16 mitoses per 10 hpf are seen. At the interface between viable and necrotic tumour, the tumour appears less cellular with a haphazard arrangement of the malignant spindled cells. The residual tumour shows features consistent with previous treatment (fibrinoid necrosis of vessels with superimposed myxohyaline change, inflammation and extensive necrosis as previously described). The overlying shows reactive changes.\n\nThe margins of excision are as follows:\nProximal: Clear of tumour (at least 10mm) (1)\nDistal: 3.3mm (16)\nMedial: 4mm (2)\nLateral: 3.3mm (12)\nDeep: 5mm (7)\nSuperficial (distal end - no overlying skin): 2.2mm (15)\n\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:\nTumour cells positive for: Pancytokeratin (focal ?aberrant), P40 (focal ?aberrant), CD34 (patchy cytoplasmic staining).\nTumour cells negative for: TLE1 (focal non-specific), CAM5.2, CD31, STAT6, myogenin, desmin (focal non-specific), CD99 (non-specific), SMA, S100 and SOX10.\nH3K27me3 shows loss of nuclear staining in most tumour cells (&amp;gt;85%).\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe 170mm posterior arm lesion is a high grade spindled/sarcomatoid malignancy. The appearance is similar to that described in the recent core biopsy (DHM 14171-21MP Dr Scheel) including loss of H3K27me3. However, no demonstrable S100, SOX10 or smooth/skeletal muscle staining is seen.\n\nOverall, the findings support the original preferred diagnosis of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour. There is no definitive rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation.\n\nGrading of sarcomas may not be reliable after treatment, however, in the material examined the overall features would be in keeping with FNCLCC grade 3 (high grade).\n(Tumour score = 3; mitosis score = 2; necrosis = 2; total score = 7/8).\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nLeft posterior arm: 170mm high grade spindled/sarcomatoid malignancy, clear of margins (see comment).\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 37W447669F\nMEDICALRECORD: 37844766\nHOSPITAL: YARRAWONGA HEALTH\nDOCTOR: I Duartes\nDOCTOR: I Bergren\nDATE: 27/5/71=>2071-05-27\nDOCTOR: I Taub\nDOCTOR: I Boerger\nDOCTOR: Scheel\n"}]}

There is a moderately to variable markedly cellular spindled to epithelioid/rhabdoid cell proliferation with scattered osteoclastic type and tumour giant cells. The cytoplasm is eosinophilic but no unequivocal striation is seen. There appears to be a variable abrupt transition from lower to widespread higher grade/pleomorphic areas (best seen in 6). The nuclei show variation in size with mostly intermediate to scattered marked pleomorphism. The nuclei are ovoid with irregular nuclear membranes, some coarse chromatin and some show distinct nucleoli. There are areas of more prominent thick collagen bundles in between the tumour, hyalinisation and coagulative and infarct type necrosis. Florid mitotic activity is seen (31mitoses/10HPF with field diameter 0.55mm) including some atypical forms. The scattered single more prominent atypical cells (up to 3 times the size of the average tumour cell combined with atypical mitoses and the small circumscribed area of increased atypia are best regarded a focal areas of anaplasia.\nThe peripheral 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin is best regarded as focally involved (3) at the level of subcutis and in another focus the 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin is less than 0.1mm away (6). The 3 o&amp;apos;clock peripheral margin is 4mm away.The deep margin is 1.6mm with an intact soft tissue plane (4). The other margins are further away.\nThe overlying skin shows moderate sun damage.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nThe tumour cells are diffusely positive for desmin (cytoplasmic). SMA shows patchy positive staining. Myogenin (nuclear) shows scattered single and small aggregates of positive cells. INI-1 shows retained nuclear staining. EMA shows scattered single cells with rather membranous staining. Pancytokeratin shows scattered small aggregates of staining\nThe tumour cells are negative for ERG, Sox10 and S100.\n\nThe morphological and immunohistochemical features show some similarity to the previous description in the core biopsy report from DHM. In the outside core biopsy Myogenin and Pancytokeratin were negative in contrast to the current excision however this may represent sampling.\n\nComment: The features are those of a rhabdomyosarcoma with some spindled areas including tumour giant cells and some sclerosis associated with focal anaplasia. The features are favoured to represent spindle cell/sclerosing type with patchy areas of pleomorphism over pleomorphic subtype.

The testis shows Leydig cell hyperplasia and age-related changes.  There is a region of fibrosis associated with an organising haematoma and focal haemosiderin deposition in keeping with previous surgery.  In addition, there are small numbers of dispersed atypical spindle to stellate cells with enlarged hyperchromatic and irregular nuclei.  These atypical cells are seen throughout the entirety of the specimen.  The background stroma has a fibrous to myxoid appearance.  In areas, the adipocytes show a mild degree of variation in cell sizes.  The histology is consistent with a well-differentiated liposarcoma with mixed lipoma-like and sclerosing features.\n\nThe atypical cells extends to the spermatic cord shave margin as well as the deep margin focally.  Assessment of clearance amongst the rest of the margins is difficult due to the subtle cell size variation amongst the adipocytes and the sparsely distributed nature of the atypical cells.  Recognising this limitation, the excision margins are summarised as follows:\n-  Spermatic cord margin:  Involved by tumour (Block 1).\n-  Superficial:  3 mm (Block 27).\n-  Deep:  Involved by tumour (Block 19).\n-  Superior:  &amp;gt; 10 mm.\n-  Inferior:  6 mm (Block 55).\n-  Medial:  1 mm (Blocks 41 &amp;amp; 42).\n-  Lateral:  2 mm (Blocks 39 &amp;amp; 50).\nThe overlying skin is uninvolved.

The tumour is 22mm from the 3 o&amp;apos;clock margin, 25mm from the 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin and abuts the deep margin.  30% of the tumour is possibly necrotic and there are areas of myxoid change.

See diagram.  (TO:YL/ec 29/10/71)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Kuligowski):\nSections show skin excised to include subcutaneous fat plus a small amount of underlying skeletal muscle. There is a lobulated and somewhat circumscribed cellular tumour centred in the subcutaneous fat. The tumour focally bulges into deep dermis. The superficial dermis, epidermis and skeletal muscle are uninvolved. The tumour is composed of compact fascicles of plump spindle cells with moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and one to two nucleoli. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen and focally number up to 4 per 10 HPF. Necrosis is not identified. There are moderate numbers of admixed inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils within the tumour. The tumour also shows nodular areas of hyalinisation and myxoid change associated with foamy histiocytes and haemosiderin laden macrophages. These alteration is regarded as treatment related changes and is seen in approximately 60% of the tumour. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.\n\nThe tumour cells show the following immunoprofile:\n-  Positive:  EMA.\n-  Equivocal:  S100 (scattered tumour cells, no more than 5%) and Melan A (faint cytoplasmic staining in around 1% of tumour cells).\n-  Negative:  MNF116, Cam5.2, CK5/6, SOX10, HMB45, MUM1, CD34, SMA, desmin, myogenin, STAT6, MUC4 and ALK.\nNuclear expression of H3K37m3 is retained.\nThe Ki-67 proliferation index is up to around 10% at hotspots by visual estimation.\n\nThe overall features are those of a malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.\n\nThe cellular tumour mass itself is 1 mm from the deep margin (Block 14). However, the tissue deep to the tumour has a paucicellular and loose myxoid appearance in which there are interspersed atypical cells . These cells may represent reactive atypia in benign stromal cells although tumour cells with treatment effect can show a similar cytology and as such, definite clearance of tumour at the deep margin cannot be guaranteed. This loose myxoid change is present at the deep margin over at least a 5 mm front (Blocks 13, 14 &amp;amp; 15). The tumour mass and deep loose myxoid stromal change are &amp;gt; 10 mm from all peripheral margins.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nExcision of lesion, right forearm (post radiotherapy):  Malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with treatment effect\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 48M853766S\nMEDICALRECORD: 4848537\nHOSPITAL: GOULBURN BASE HOSPITAL\nDATE: 29/10/71=>2071-10-29\nDOCTOR: M Kuligowski\n"}]}

Sections show fragments of apparently subcapsular liver with fibrosis and chronic inflammation without fibrous tissue and bile ducts within fibrous tissue.  Negative for malignancy.\nC.  Sections of both macroscopically identified tumour masses have similar morrphology.  The appearances are those of diffuse type gastric carcinoma (poorly cohesive carcinoma) including signet ring cells. There is a wide variation in the morphology of tumour cells including some with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, some with increased nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, some with vacuolated cytoplasm and some with targetoid intracytoplasmic inclusions. In addition there are foci of squamous differentiation identified including rare intercellular bridges and these are positive for CK5/6 and p-40. The squamous differentiation form less than 25% of the tumour volume (and hence does not fulfil criteria given by some authors for a diagnosis of adenosquamous carcinoma). The diffuse gastric carcinoma is positive for CK20 (strong diffuse), focal CK7, and strong diffuse E-cadherin.\nThere is prominent lymphatic vascular space invasion.\nBoth macroscopic tumour masses  involve the full thickness of the gastric wall to reach the adjacent serosa and with infiltration of the immediately adjacent greater omentum.  Sections of the stomach in between the two main tumour masses show lymphatic permeation by carcinoma as well as deposits of infiltrative carcinoma within the submucosa.  It is likely that one of the macroscopic tumour masses represents intragastric spread of the other tumour.\nCarcinoma is 12mm from the proximal resection margin and is not seen in the sections from the distal resection margin.\nThere is patchy chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa.

The testis shows Leydig cell hyperplasia and age-related changes.  There is a region of fibrosis associated with an organising haematoma and focal haemosiderin deposition in keeping with previous surgery.  In addition, there are small numbers of dispersed atypical spindle to stellate cells with enlarged hyperchromatic and irregular nuclei.  These atypical cells are seen throughout the entirety of the specimen.  The background stroma has a fibrous to myxoid appearance.  In areas, the adipocytes show a mild degree of variation in cell sizes.  The histology is consistent with a well-differentiated liposarcoma with mixed lipoma-like and sclerosing features.\n\nThe atypical cells extends to the spermatic cord shave margin as well as the deep margin focally.  Assessment of clearance amongst the rest of the margins is difficult due to the subtle cell size variation amongst the adipocytes and the sparsely distributed nature of the atypical cells.  Recognising this limitation, the excision margins are summarised as follows:\n-  Spermatic cord margin:  Involved by tumour (Block 1).\n-  Superficial:  3 mm (Block 27).\n-  Deep:  Involved by tumour (Block 19).\n-  Superior:  &amp;gt; 10 mm.\n-  Inferior:  6 mm (Block 55).\n-  Medial:  1 mm (Blocks 41 &amp;amp; 42).\n-  Lateral:  2 mm (Blocks 39 &amp;amp; 50).\nThe overlying skin is uninvolved.

No single signet ring cells are seen. Four small mesenteric and mesocolic lymph nodes are identified which do not contain deposits of tumour.  Immunostains show positivity for CK20 and synpatophysin, CK7 and chromogranin are negative. However Ki67 is high at &amp;gt;80% which is way beyond that acceptable for goblet cell carcinoid and therefore the current deposits are best considered as moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Bready):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr M Penrod who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Miquel comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

There is a tumour arising from the transverse colon which is circumferential with polypoid raised edges and necrotic centre, approximately measuring 80x50mm. This tumour is involving the wall to extensively involve the overlying serosa. There is extensive involvement of the adjacent omentum and the mesentery and the wall of the adjacent distal segment of the transverse colon. This distal involvement appears to be involving the wall to reach the mucosal surface which is nodular in the distal, 80mm of the specimen, to involve the distal margin. Otherwise, the main tumour is located 40mm of the proximal margin and abuts the radial surgical resection margin macroscopically.

There is diffuse positive staining for CK7.  The tumour is negative for CDX2 and shows mostly negative staining for CK20 with a few islands of positive cells.\nThere is negative staining with GATA3, TTF1, PAX8, D2-40, Chromogranin, synaptophysin, and WT1.

It appears to be located mostly in the submucosa and undermines the mucosa, with occasional tongues extending up and rupturing through the mucosal surface.  There is extensive serosal involvement.  The immunostaining pattern is unusual and may represent the effect of chemotherapy. The loss of CDX2 and CK20 and gain of CK7 in colorectal carcinoma has been described in the literature and is associated with poor prognosis (Loss of CDX2 expression is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Bae JM et al. World J Gastroenterol 2015 February 7; 21(5): 1457-1467).

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Yohe):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr V Bognar who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Lucius comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

The attached fallopian tube is 58mm in length x 5mm in diameter and appears unremarkable with the exception of a 7mm parafimbrial cyst.  A 3 x 3mm yellow nodule is noted on the serosal surface of the soft tissue between the ovary and fallopian tube.  The ovary is sectioned transversely into 9 slices and shows a relatively well circumscribed 19 x 11 x approximately 20mm pale yellow lesion underlying the puckered serosal region (slices 4 to 8).

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Baitner):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr W Schied who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Shannon comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

RS (M-32/ED/ank)\nMICROSCOPIC:  (Z Bassett)\nThe sections of the gallbladder show deposits of extracellular mucus on the serosal surface with some groups and strips of attenuated cuboidal epithelium with low grade nuclear cytology.\nSections of the spleen show normal appearing splenic parenchyma.  On the serosal surface, there are deposits of extracellular mucus associated with columnar mucinous epithelium with intermediate gradecytology.  There is also infiltration of reactive fibroblastic connective tissue by small groups of cells and infiltrative pattern glands showing intermediate grade cytology including nuclear hyperchromasia and  nuclear shape and membraneirregularities.\nSections of the omentum and peritoneal tissue show deposits of extracellular mucus associated with dense fibrous connective tissue and with columnar mucinous epithelium with intermediate nuclear grade features.  There is infiltration of connective tissue with reactive desmoplastic stroma by variably sized glands and small nests of tumour cells.   A focus of endometriosis is also identified.\nSections of the three separate segments of bowel show small and large bowel with normal mucosa and normal wall.  The serosa and adventitia contains mucinous tumour with similar appearances to that seen in the previous specimen including intermediate grade nuclear cytology.Several mesenteric lymph nodes are seen and show reactive changes only.\nSections of the right hemicolectomy specimen show an appendix in which the distal appendix is occupied by a tumour with combined morphology. There is a component of villous pattern mucinous tumour that penetrates the wall of the appendix to reach the adjacent periappendiceal connective tissues with intermediate nucleargrade features and desmoplastic stromal reaction and with associated metaplastic calcification. There is an associated usual type carcinoid (neuroendocrine tumour grade 1) growing in nests and cords and small groups of cells, and forming rosette structures.  The carcinoid shows granular chromatin and inconspicuous nucleoli.  The carcinoid tumour component measures 20mm in diameter and infiltrates through the full thickness of the wall of the appendix to focally involve the mesoappendix.\nFourteen periappendiceal and mesenteric lymph nodes are identified and show reactive changes only.  The proximal and distal margins of the hemicolectomy specimen are unremarkable.\nImmunohistochemistry (Block 25 &amp;#8211; distal appendix): The mucinous tumour shows strongstaining for CDX2 and CK20, and moderate staining for CK7. The carcinoid tumour shows positive stianing for CAM5.2, CDX-2, synaptophysin, chromogranin, and with less than 2% staining with Ki-67\nComment:  The appearances are those of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the peritoneal surfaces with associated prominent extracellular mucus production (pseudomyxoma peritonei clinical pattern).  In the appendix, there is a combined mucinous tumour consistent with mucinous adenocarcinoma that penetrates through the appendiceal wall, and with associated with ususal type carcinoid (neuroendocrine tumour grade 1).

There is a lobulated and somewhat circumscribed cellular tumour centred in the subcutaneous fat. The tumour focally bulges into deep dermis. The superficial dermis, epidermis and skeletal muscle are uninvolved. The tumour is composed of compact fascicles of plump spindle cells with moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and one to two nucleoli. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen and focally number up to 4 per 10 HPF. Necrosis is not identified. There are moderate numbers of admixed inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils within the tumour. The tumour also shows nodular areas of hyalinisation and myxoid change associated with foamy histiocytes and haemosiderin laden macrophages. These alteration is regarded as treatment related changes and is seen in approximately 60% of the tumour. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.\n\nThe tumour cells show the following immunoprofile:\n-  Positive:  EMA.\n-  Equivocal:  S100 (scattered tumour cells, no more than 5%) and Melan A (faint cytoplasmic staining in around 1% of tumour cells).\n-  Negative:  MNF116, Cam5.2, CK5/6, SOX10, HMB45, MUM1, CD34, SMA, desmin, myogenin, STAT6, MUC4 and ALK.\nNuclear expression of H3K37m3 is retained.\nThe Ki-67 proliferation index is up to around 10% at hotspots by visual estimation.\n\nThe overall features are those of a malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.\n\nThe cellular tumour mass itself is 1 mm from the deep margin (Block 14). However, the tissue deep to the tumour has a paucicellular and loose myxoid appearance in which there are interspersed atypical cells . These cells may represent reactive atypia in benign stromal cells although tumour cells with treatment effect can show a similar cytology and as such, definite clearance of tumour at the deep margin cannot be guaranteed. This loose myxoid change is present at the deep margin over at least a 5 mm front (Blocks 13, 14 &amp;amp; 15). The tumour mass and deep loose myxoid stromal change are &amp;gt; 10 mm from all peripheral margins.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nExcision of lesion, right forearm (post radiotherapy):  Malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with treatment effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecimenReceivedDate\n2737-09-03 00:00:00\n\n\nLastName\nVibert\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "DATE: 19940518=>1994-05-18\nHOSPITAL: BENALLA HEALTH\nPATIENT: Jessie\nIDNUM: 32J015881C\nMEDICALRECORD: 3230158\nPATIENT: Lamar\nDATE: 29/10/71=>2071-10-29\nDOCTOR: J Carrales\nTIME: 2737-09-03 00:00:00=>2737-09-03T00:00:00\nPATIENT: Vibert\n"}]}

The uterus measures 78 x 50 x 43mm and has a smooth serosal surface with two small yellow nodules on the posterior aspect, 8 x 7mm (adjacent to left cornu) and 6 x 5mm (superior to posterior peritoneal reflection). On the anterior serosal surface are four grey nodules, 1 to 3mm in extent.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 25mm and appears unremarkable.  On sectioning, the endometrium is 2 to 4mm in maximum thickness (greatest in the cervical canal) and the myometrium is up to 31mm; containing two fibroids, 6mm and 30mm in maximum diameter.\nBlocks:  E1 to E6 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; E7 to E9 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; E10 - right cornu; E11 - left cornu; E12 - yellow nodule near peritoneal reflection; E13 - yellow nodule near left cornu (bisected); E14 - anterior serosal nodules (two representative sections).\n\nF.

The attached fallopian tube is 58mm in length x 5mm in diameter and appears unremarkable with the exception of a 7mm parafimbrial cyst.  A 3 x 3mm yellow nodule is noted on the serosal surface of the soft tissue between the ovary and fallopian tube.  The ovary is sectioned transversely into 9 slices and shows a relatively well circumscribed 19 x 11 x approximately 20mm pale yellow lesion underlying the puckered serosal region (slices 4 to 8).

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Capitano):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr W Vaneekelen who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Erasmo comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

RS (M-6/LK/ank)\n\nMICROSCOPIC:   (Dr. L Sperow)\nSections show adipose tissue extensively infiltrated by a clear cell tumour.  The tumour has a predominantly papillary growth pattern, but also shows areas of tubular growth pattern.  There are scattered psammoma bodies present.  The papillary cores in some areas have a hyalinised appearance.  In some areas, eosinophilic material is seen within the tubular structures.  Individual tumour cells have abundant clear cytoplasm, and irregular nuclei with some nuclear membrane folding, and small nucleoli.  There is little or no nuclear stratification in most areas.  Mitotic figures are extremely sparse (less than 1 per 10 high power fields).  Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumour is positive for EMA, PAX8, Ber-EP4, CK7, and HBME-1.  It shows very weak variable focal positivity for p53, and very focal positivity for Napsin A.  It is negative for WT1, cytokeratin 20, calretinin, CEA, p16, AMACR, and D-240.\nThis case has been subject to intradepartmental consultation.  The appearances raise a differential diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma versus serous carcinoma.  The overall histologic appearance and immunohistochemical staining pattern favours clear cell carcinoma.

In the centre of the excision is a 50 x 43mm nodule.  Skeletal muscle is present on the deep surface.  3 o&amp;apos;clock inked blue and 9 o&amp;apos;clock inked black.  Specimen is sectioned from proximal to distal into nine slices.  There is a lobulated tan tumour 55 x 45 x 25mm.  The tumour is 22mm from the 3 o&amp;apos;clock margin, 25mm from the 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin and abuts the deep margin.  30% of the tumour is possibly necrotic and there are areas of myxoid change.

See diagram.  (TO:YL/ec 29/10/71)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr O Braddy):\nSections show skin excised to include subcutaneous fat plus a small amount of underlying skeletal muscle. There is a lobulated and somewhat circumscribed cellular tumour centred in the subcutaneous fat. The tumour focally bulges into deep dermis. The superficial dermis, epidermis and skeletal muscle are uninvolved. The tumour is composed of compact fascicles of plump spindle cells with moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and one to two nucleoli. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen and focally number up to 4 per 10 HPF. Necrosis is not identified. There are moderate numbers of admixed inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils within the tumour. The tumour also shows nodular areas of hyalinisation and myxoid change associated with foamy histiocytes and haemosiderin laden macrophages. These alteration is regarded as treatment related changes and is seen in approximately 60% of the tumour. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.\n\nThe tumour cells show the following immunoprofile:\n-  Positive:  EMA.\n-  Equivocal:  S100 (scattered tumour cells, no more than 5%) and Melan A (faint cytoplasmic staining in around 1% of tumour cells).\n-  Negative:  MNF116, Cam5.2, CK5/6, SOX10, HMB45, MUM1, CD34, SMA, desmin, myogenin, STAT6, MUC4 and ALK.\nNuclear expression of H3K37m3 is retained.\nThe Ki-67 proliferation index is up to around 10% at hotspots by visual estimation.\n\nThe overall features are those of a malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.\n\nThe cellular tumour mass itself is 1 mm from the deep margin (Block 14). However, the tissue deep to the tumour has a paucicellular and loose myxoid appearance in which there are interspersed atypical cells . These cells may represent reactive atypia in benign stromal cells although tumour cells with treatment effect can show a similar cytology and as such, definite clearance of tumour at the deep margin cannot be guaranteed. This loose myxoid change is present at the deep margin over at least a 5 mm front (Blocks 13, 14 &amp;amp; 15). The tumour mass and deep loose myxoid stromal change are &amp;gt; 10 mm from all peripheral margins.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nExcision of lesion, right forearm (post radiotherapy):  Malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with treatment effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecimenReceivedDate\n2737-09-03 00:00:00\n\n\nLastName\nUnikel\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "DATE: 19940518=>1994-05-18\nHOSPITAL: ROMA HOSPITAL\nPATIENT: Elijah\nIDNUM: 54Y420989P\nMEDICALRECORD: 5494209\nPATIENT: Collin\nDATE: 29/10/71=>2071-10-29\nDOCTOR: O Braddy\nTIME: 2737-09-03 00:00:00=>2737-09-03T00:00:00\nPATIENT: Unikel\n"}]}

RS (M-37/ MC/cy)\n\nMICROSCOPIC:   (Dr Q Kilduff)\nSections of the gallbladder, spleen and omentum show numerous serosal deposits of mucinous tumour. Within the mucin and also within fibroblastic reaction and infiltrating into adipose tissue are nests and groups of tumour cells with intermediate to focally high grade nuclear features including nuclear hyperchromasia and nuclear shape irregularities. There is multi-vacuolated cytoplasm in some cells including some signet ring cells and in some nests of tumour cells there is a somewhat goblet cell like morphology of some cell groups.\nSections of the first described segment  of small bowel show numerous serosal, subserosal and mesenteric deposits of mucinous tumour with groups on nests of cells with mucinous cytoplasm including signet ring cells. These infiltrate within the mucus pools and also within fibroblastic and fibrous stroma.\nSections of the right hemicolectomy show destruction of the appendix by mucinous tumour composed of mucinous pools with nests and groups of cells with  mucinous cytoplasm including signet ring cells. These are also seen on the serosal surfaces of the adjacent mesoappendix and mesocolon and on the serosal surface of the segment of terminal ileum. At the base of the appendix there is infiltration of poorly differentiated mucinous tumour within the submucosa and mucosa and muscularis propria of the appendix and caecum. Signet ring cells and some groups with goblet cell morphology are seen.\nTwo lymph nodes are identified and these show reactive changes.\nThe other nodules are macroscopically thought to be possible lymph nodes representing extranodal deposits of mucinous tumour within mesentery/mesocolon.\nSections of the next described longest segment of large bowel show serosal deposits of tumour similar to that previously described.\nSections of the second piece of large bowel show serosal deposits of tumour similar to that previously described.\nSections of the smallest segment of bowel consists of small bowel with full thickness involvement of the serosa, muscularis propria, submucosa and mucosa with infiltrating tumour composed of nests, groups and cords of cells with  abundant mucinous cytoplasm.\nSection of the separate fragment of fibrofatty tissue consistent with peritoneum show nodules of tumour similar to that previously described.\nImmunohistochemistry: There is positive staining for CK20 and CDX-2. CK7 is negative. Rare cells are positive for chromogranin and synaptohysin in the metastatic deposits and occasional cells are positive for there in the section from the base of the appendix. Ki-67 shows variable staining that ranges from less than 10% to at least 20% in some areas/nests of tumour.\nCOMMENT:\nThe appearances are those of poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells and the primary site appears to be the appendix. There are also nests of cells with a goblet cell morphology, however the majority of the tumour tissue does not show features of neuroendocrine differentiation. Nevertheless the appearances are suggestive that the tumour arose in a pre-existing goblet cell carcinoid but this has been overrun by mucinous adenocarcinoma.\nThe peritoneal disease is classified as high grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei (with signet ring cells) [PSOGI classification system].\nDIAGNOSIS:\nPERITONECTOMY:\nAPPENDICEAL MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA WITH SIGNET RING CELLS AND,\nHIGH GRADE MUCINOUS CARCINOMA PERITONEI WITH SIGNET RING CELLS - SEE TEXT AND COMMENT.\n\n22/2/2066 ht\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 69Q562005G\nMEDICALRECORD: 69656200\nHOSPITAL: CLARE HOSPITAL\nIDNUM: 69Q56200\nIDNUM: 69Q562005G\nPATIENT: LONGOBARDI, KURTIS HOLLIS\nDOCTOR: Q Kilduff\nDATE: 22/2/2066=>2066-02-22\n"}]}

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Secky):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr I Debore who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Carlo comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.
