At this location the advancing edge shows dispersed, often single cell infiltration and it is very difficult to distinguish tumour cells from background inflammatory cells, due to lack of typical carcinoma morphology (cytoplasmic clearing, nuclear pyknosis and loss of nucleoli) related to androgen deprivation therapy.  However a keratin immunostain (AE1/AE3) highlights single cells at the inked margin (ink on tumour cells) and the margin is best regarded as positive.  The P540S immunoperoxidase stains is also positive in single cells here, but there may be some background staining of non-neoplastic cells.  Multiple levels have been reviewed.  Elsewhere, including at the base in the area of extraprostatic extension, the margins are clear.\nShown to Dr U Leitzel who concurs.\nPerineural invasion:  Present extensive\nSeminal vesicles:  Involved \nThe muscular walls of both the right (A12) and left (A19) seminalvesicles are invaded by acinar adenocarcinoma \nLymph nodes:  Six negative lymph nodes (0/6) \n(Three (3) negative right pelvic lymph; three (3) negative left pelvic lymph nodes) (\nLymphovascular invasion:  Not seen \nStage N(AJCC/UICC TNM system, 7th edition):\npT3b  Seminal vesicle invasion \npN0  No positive regional nodes. \nMX  Cannot be assessed histologically\nR1  Microscopic residual tumour\nOther:\nThe non-involved acini show patchy atrophy and basal cell hyperplasia.

The scar is AE in 5 blocks from 12 to 6 o'clock margin.   (WW/ta 10/2/63) \nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof Q Stohler): \nA.  Sections of solardamaged skin show a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma showing focal keratinisation.  The tumour invades into deep subcutis to a depth of approximately 4mm.  \nCarcinoma extends to 0.5mm of the deep margin and within 0.5mmof the 3 o'clock margin.   The carcinoma appears well clear of the 9 o'clock, 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock margins.  \nA focus of perineural invasion is identified at the deep aspect of the tumour.  This focus is best seen in the CAM 5.2 stain where it is approximately 1mm from the deep margin.  \nImmunohistochemistry:\nThe tumour cells show positive staining with CAM 5.2 but are negative for melanoma markers HMB45, Melan A and S100.  \nThe S100 stain shows patchy staining.  The majority of tumour cells appear to be negative and it is possible that the staining is of dendritic cells in the background particularly given the negative result for HMB45 and Melan A.  \nB.  Sections show a fragment of fibroadipose tissue with attached skeletal muscle.  No epidermis is present in thesections.  There is a circumscribed nodule composed of highly atypical, large epithelioid cells with prominent nucleoli.  No pigment is identified within these cells.  There is an infiltrate of lymphocytes at the periphery of this nodule raising the possibility that this may represent a lymph node metastases.  Lymphovascular invasion is also identified in the immediately adjacent connective tissue.  \nThe tumour cells show strong positive staining for HMB45, Melan A and S100 but are negative for CAM 5.2.  The morphological and immunohistochemical findings would be consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma.  The lines of excision appear clear of the tumour by a distance of 0.1mm superficially.  The other margins appear well clear.  \nC.  The sections of solar damaged skin show no evidence of malignancy.  There is a small focus of chronic inflammation and fat necrosis in the subcutis, possibly relating to previous biopsy of surgery.  A seborrhoeic keratosis is noted on the skin surface as well as an area of actinic keratosis.  \nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.  Lesion scar, stitch right anterior:  \n-  Squamous cell carcinoma, excision appears close but clear.  \nB.  Upper back:  \n-  Consistent with metastatic melanoma.  \nC.

The specimen includes attached gallbladder 95mm x 45mm, greater omentum 80 x 30 x 15mm and lesser omentum 25 x 25 x 10mm. There are two separate pieces of presumed greater omental tissue 360 and 80mm in maximum dimension with an area of grey discolouration 40 x 35 x 10mm identified on one surface. The margins are inked as follows: pancreatic neck resection margin black,  periuncinate soft tissue (SMA) resection margin green, the portal vein bed resection margin blue (including the portal vein wall identified by Dr Fechtner),  posterior retroperitoneal margin orange, anterior pancreatic surface purple and the inferior pancreaticsurface yellow.\n The cut surface reveals an ill-defined grey area (? tumour) with loss of lobular architecture in the anterior superior head of pancreas measuring approximately 25 x 22 x 12mm.  There is a firm yellow area within the adjacent fat (? fat necrosis ? tumour extension) measuring 12 x 12 x 8mm.  The pancreatic duct is not identified.   The common bile duct is patent via a stent which extends its full length to the opening at the ampulla of Vater, the latter with an unremarkable mucosal surface. The mucosa of the duodenum and stomach is unremarkable. The serosa of the gallbladder appears mildly haemorrhagic.  The maximum thickness of the wall is 3mm.  No gallstones are identified.  One large lymph node 15mm is identified in the attached greater omental fat and multiple small lymph nodes are identified around the common bile duct margin.  \nBlock 1 - common bile duct margin; 2 - bowel and stomach resection margins; 3-9 - TS of pancreas to small bowel; 10-14 - full face of pancreas from inferior to superior; 15-20 - TS superior end of pancreas (paired blocks 16/17, 18/19); 21 & 22 - large greater omentum lymph node; 23 - lymph nodes around common bile duct; 24 - ? lesser omentum lymph nodes; 25 - ? greater omentum lymph node; 26 -representative gallbladder; 27-30 - representative greater omentum. Please refer to attached diagram.  (TO: CV;CT/ec 2.8.62) \n MICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr S Matro) \nSections show a moderately to poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma centred within pancreatic head.  The tumour is predominantly  composed of small to large round to angulated glands with moderate to focally marked nuclear pleomorphism, occasionally  prominent nucleoli, eosinophilic cytoplasm, foci of goblet cell differentiation and patchy intraluminalnecrosis.  There are also numerous foci of single cell infiltration. \nExtent\nThe tumour has an infiltrative margin and focally extends into the wall of the stented intrapancreatic common bile duct, infiltrates around the pancreatic duct and extensively infiltrates the wall of the duodenum reachingnon-ulcerated mucosa.  The tumour invades fibrous tissue in proximity to the portal vein wall but no mural smooth muscle invasion is seen. There is also extrapancreatic invasion into adipose tissue posteriorly (perineural spread) and into adipose tissue between the duodenal wall and pancreas superiorly (contiguous invasion and perineural spread).  Extensiveperineural invasion is present both within the confines of tumour and as outlying foci.  A focus of mural vascular invasion is present and foci suspicious for lymphovascular invasion present, including within the duodenal wall.  Retractionartefact around tumour does make assessment of lymphovascular invasion difficult. \nTumour response to therapy:\nAlthough there is some fibrosis around tumour, there is extensive residual tumour and no significant tumour necrosis.  The tumour regression grade is therefore 3 (poor response).\nMargins\nThe pancreatic neck margin is 0.2mm from tumour, the portal vein margin <0.1mm from tumour (with perineural invasion 0.2mm from this margin) while the portal vein wall resection margins is at least 0.5mm from tumour (some sectioning disruption of this margin limits assessment). The periuncinate margin is >5.5mm clear and the posterior retroperitoneal surface is 4mm clear.  The extrahepatic common bile duct, duodenal and gastric margins are all well clear.\n \nOther pathology\nThe pancreas shows associated changes of chronic pancreatitis with ductolobular atrophy, fibrosis and chronic inflammation.  Away from the tumour there is mucinous and goblet cell metaplasia of ductules and focal mucinous metaplasia with micropapillae formation in a larger duct (PanIN/L 1B).  Changes consistent with previous surgery are present with suture/foreign body granulomas with the greater omentum and serosa of stomach plus chronic inflammation and fat necrosis with admixed giant cells within the peripancreatic fat.  The area of grey discolouration described in the greater omentum comprises fibrosis and suture granulomas.  Within adipose tissue posterior to the pancreas, there is also an abscess containing filamentous material suggestive of Actinomyces organisms.  The common bile duct shows mucosal erosions, mural acute inflammation and reactive epithelial atypia consistent with stent-related injury.  The gallbladder shows mucosal haemorrhage and mild chronic cholecystitis.

Within the areas of altered stroma the histiocytes are highlighted with a CD68 immunostain while keratin AE1/AE3 immunostains are negative.  No residual invasive carcinoma is seen in multiple levels examined in this area and through multiple slices extending to a  separate area in which there is a similar stromal response (? site of unidentified clip - block 34). There are dispersed scattered foci of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) with clinging and cribriform architecture distributed across 12mm (three consecutive slices).

The segment of rectum measures 155mm in length x 40mm in open diameter.  The peritoneal reflection is 100mm from the distal surgical margin.  On opening the rectal mucosa appears unremarkable and no tumour is identified.  The ureter is 45mm in length x 3 x 3mm in diameter.  The patch of vaginal vault measures25 x 20mm and the adherent patch of bladder measures 20 x 22mm.  The tumour mass itself has indistinct borders which incorporate thepararectal fat over an area of 110 x 55 x 40mm.  The tumour is located 35mm above and 80mm below the rectal peritoneal reflection.  The tumour appears adherent to the rectal mesentery and also appears to be adherent to the attached oriented structures (bladder, vagina vault and left ureter). On sectioning the tumour has multifocal solid and cystic components. There is tan rubber tumour abutting the Pouch of Douglas measuring 15 x 8 x 15mm.  The tumour appears to abut the bladder with the thick band of fibrous tissue between the bladder mucosa and the tumour.  A second cystic area (60 x 55 x 25mm) is distal to the first tumour. The cavity is filled with a dark brown haemoserous fluid.  This tumour nodule appears to abut but not invade the distal rectum and to abut the vaginal vault margin.  The tumour is 30mm from the distal rectal surgical margin, 2mm from the radial rectal margin and 80mm from the proximal rectal margin and 5mmfrom the ureter.\nThe tumour appears to abut the anterior surgical resection margin between the vagina shave and the bladder shave (block 7).  The tumour appears to also abut the right and left margins (block 9 and 10 respectively).  The smaller tumour nodule appears to abut the posterior bladder and abut the rectum.  The distal margin is more than 40mm away from the tumour.  There is also a third smaller nodule of cream tumour measuring 7 x 5 x 5mm within the mesentery.  This could represent lymphatic spread.

The ellipse of skin measures 127 x 35mm and the surface of the skin appears unremarkable.  The underlying subcutaneous tissue and muscle measures 110 x 60 x 30mm.  There are two sutures as designated (long lateral, short superior, the short suture is designated 12 o'clock and the long suture designated 3 o'clock.  The 12 o'clock margin is inked blue and the 6 o'clock margin black.  There is a gelatinous tan heterogenous tumour within the muscle extending to the deep subcutaneous tissue.  The tumour has areas of haemorrhage and focal calcification.  The tumour mass measures 40 x 30 x 40mm.  The margins are as follows.  2mm 6 o'clock, 8mm 12 o'clock, 3mm deep, 35mm 3 o'clock and 35mm 9 o'clock.

(TO: ZC:  RT/mm 2.12.63)\nMICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr U Protano)\nSections are of skin extending to deep subcutaneous tissue, including skeletal muscle at the deep aspect. The 40mm subcutaneous tumour is a high grade sarcomatoid tumour. The tumour consists of moderately to markedly atypical stellate to spindled cells withina variably fibromyxoid and hyalinised stroma. The tumour cells are arranged in sheets, poorly formed fascicular structures and in a storiform pattern surrounded by vascularised fibromyxoid stroma. Numerous highly atypical, bizarre multinucleated tumour cells are seen. In some areas, hyalinised bands of osteoid-like material separate malignant tumour cells (osteoid present in approximately 10% of tumour). Focal chondroid matrix and calcified bone formation are also seen. The tumour shows increased mitotic activity, includingscattered atypical mitoses. Very occasional foci of necrosis (up to 5%) are present. The tumour infiltrates the surrounding fibroadipose tissue and skeletal muscle, and numerous degenerate skeletal muscle fibres are seen. The surrounding adipose tissue contains scattered atypical cells, however, no lipoblasts are identified. Background epidermal and dermocutaneous changes in keeping with history of previous radiotherapy are seen. An incidental benign naevus (clear of margins) is present. \nThe margins are as follows:\n12 o'clock margin: 4.4mm (block 5).\n3 o'clock margin: Well clear (>10mm).\n6 o'clock margin: Focal positive margin (block 7).\n9 o'clock margin: Well clear (>10mm). \nDeep margin: 1.7mm (blocks 9 and 12).\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:\nImmunohistochemical stains were performed and the results are as follows:\nTumour cells positive for: Vimentin.\nTumour cells negative for: Cam5.2, Pancytokeratin, CD34, desmin, LCA, myogenin, S100 and SMA. \nKi-67: Variable, up to 15% of tumour cell nuclei positive.\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe 40mm subcutaneous righttrapezius tumour is a high grade malignant sarcomatoid tumour. The overall morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical staining are those of a high grade pleomorphic sarcoma with focal osteosarcomatous component (approximately 10%). \nThe surrounding adipose tissue contains scattered atypical stellate cells, with smudgy chromatin and cytoplasm and variably prominent nucleoli. The possibility of a dedifferentiated liposarcoma has been considered and cannotbe entirely excluded. However, the atypia in the surrounding adipose tissue may represent single cell infiltration of fat by malignant sarcoma cells, or alternatively, radiotherapy induced atypia. However, as a dedifferentiated liposarcoma cannot be entirely excluded, FISH testing for MDM2 amplification may be useful if clinically indicated. \nPlease correlate with clinical and imaging findings. \n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nLesion right trapezius: \nHigh grade pleomorphic sarcoma with focal osteosarcomatous component (approximately 10%).\nTumour present focally at 6 o'clock margin. \nPlease see comment. \n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 80Y198956B\nMEDICALRECORD: 809198.YOQ\nPATIENT: AUGENSTEIN, CLARK\nIDNUM: 80Y19895\nSTREET: Scottish\nCITY: ECHUCA\nSTATE: VIC\nZIP: 3926\nDATE: 6/4/1995=>1995-06-04\nTIME: 10/12/2013 at 08:17=>2013-12-10T08:17\nDEPARTMENT: Immunology\nHOSPITAL: WAUCHOPE DISTRICT MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\nDOCTOR: MARTY BERRY GAVILANES\nDOCTOR: ZC\nDOCTOR: RT\nDATE: 2.12.63=>2063-02-12\nDOCTOR: U Protano\n"}]}

Peripherally the carcinoma shows a lepidic growth pattern with large columnar cells lining alveoli.  The tumour cells have basally oriented, mildly pleomorphic nuclei with variably conspicuous nucleoli and abundant pale to eosinophilic cytoplasm containing apical mucin. Centrally there is a 4.2mm zone of acinar growth with associated stromal fibrosis and chronicinflammation consistent with invasion.  No necrosis, lymphovascular invasion or perineural invasion are seen. The pleura is uninvolved. The tumour is 30mm clear of the bronchovascular resection margin and there is no evidence of carcinoma in situ at this margin.

The cellulartumour shows a haphazard, sheet-like and focally storiform arrangement of spindle cells with densely eosinophilic, somewhat granular cytoplasm, mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism, finely granular chromatin and single to multiple small eosinophilic nucleoli.  The tumour contains red blood cell-filled pseudovascular spaces, as well as capillary size vessels.  Occasional fibrous septa containing dilated vessels are also present.  There is a focal tumour necrosis (approximately 5% of tumour) and acute haemorrhage. Focal lymphovascular invasion is seen (block 3).  Tumour cell mitoses number up to 28 per 10hpf.  The tumour is 1.1mm from the resection margin (block 2)\nImmunohistochemistry:  \nThe tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive - CD34 (multifocal), Vimentin.\nEquivocal - EMA (patchy peripheral staining with background staining of liver)\nNegative - CAM 5.2, Pan CK, AE1/AE3, Desmin, S100, HMB 45, Melan A, CD31, Hepar-1, CD117 (patchy minimal cytoplasmic staining with background cytoplasmic staining of  hepatocytes.)\nCOMMENT 1:\nThe features are consistent with metastatic unclassifiable spindle cell sarcoma.  Unclassifiable spindle cell sarcoma was the diagnosis made on review by Prof. LOWELL PICCIONI in 2060 for the original pelvic tumour ; a more specific diagnosis was not possible.  The minimal patchy cytoplasmic CD117 staining with background hepatocellular staining in this case, is regarded as a negative result, especially in the context of previous negative DOG1 staining on two separate occasions.  \nThe adjacent liver shows overall preservedlobular architecture with very mild patchy portal chronic inflammation, mild fibrous expansion and focal linkage of portal tracts. There is very mild proliferation of bile ductules and periductal concentric fibrosis and possible oedema. A focal intraductal aggregate of acute inflammatory cells is also noted.  No steatosis or lobular inflammation is seen.  There is mild periportal hepatocyte copper deposition on rhodanine staining.  No stainable iron seen on Perls staining.  No dPAS positive globules seen. \nCOMMENT 2:\nThe adjacent non-tumour liver shows changes suggestive of biliary obstruction, however, these changes may represent local effects secondaryto proximity to tumour.  Further clinicopathological correlation is necessary.\nDIAGNOSIS:  \nLeft hemihepatectomy: \n-  Metastatic unclassifiable spindle cell sarcoma\n-  1.1mm from the resection margin.\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 24Y547923U\nMEDICALRECORD: 249547.ZGJ\nPATIENT: MISIASZEK, WALLACE\nIDNUM: 24Y54792\nSTREET: Old Whitins\nCITY: ANNA BAY\nSTATE: Queensland\nZIP: 5650\nDATE: 19/10/2030=>2030-10-19\nTIME: 13/11/2013 at 12:22=>2013-11-13T12:22\nHOSPITAL: GOLD COAST UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL\nDOCTOR: WILBUR TREVOR HYDZIK\nDOCTOR: CT\nDOCTOR: CF\nDATE: 16.1.63=>2063-01-16\nDOCTOR: F Keamo\nIDNUM: 24Y54792\nIDNUM: 24Y54792\nDOCTOR: LOWELL PICCIONI\nDATE: 2060=>2060\n"}]}

Specimen labelled \"Uterus, tubes, ovaries, cervix, rectosigmoid colon\" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, right and left adnexa, attached rectosigmoid colon and mesenteric fat received en bloc. \nThe uterus measures 75 x 45 x 50mm.  The serosal surface of the uterus is covered in multiple fibrous adhesions which completely obliterate the pouch of Douglas.  The uterus is adherent to the bowel posteriorly.  On opening the uterus three endometrial uterine polyps are present measuring 15 to 45mm.  The endometrium otherwise is 1mm in maximum thickness over a total wall thickness of 30mm.The myometrium is unremarkable.  The left adnexa contains a cystic structure measuring 45 x 40 x 30mm.  The cyst is unilocular with a wall thickness of 3mm.  Two solid cream masses are located adjacent to the cyst measuring 30 x 25 x 20mm and 13 x 10 x 12mm.  A possible fallopian tube is identified embedded within the larger mass.  The right adnexa containsa dark grey cystic structure measuring 45 x 35 x 25mm with a wall thickness of 5mm.  Within this cyst a tubular structure is identified ?fallopian tube.  No fimbria are identified.\nThe attached segment of bowel measures 355mm in length and is received entangled in a loop with multiple fibrous adhesions.  One end, the presumed proximal end, is stapled shut, while the other end is open.  The bowel wall appears indurated in areas with a maximum wall thickness of 15mm.  These indurated areas are approximately 90mm from the proximal margin and 100mm from the distal margin.  No mucosal lesions are identified.  A moderate amount of mesenteric fat is located on the posterior aspect of the specimen, measuring approximately 100 x 70mm.  Several lymph nodes are identified in the mesenteric fat. \nThe stapled end of the bowel is inked black.  The free end is inked blue.

Sections of the endometrium show that this is thin andinactive.  The endometrial polyps are benign.  There is extensive tumour within fibrofat adherent to the serosa of the posterior uterus and within adhesions between the loops of rectosigmoid colon and the posterior uterus.  Tumour extends from the serosal surface of the uterus some distance into the underlying outer myometrium.  The tumour has features most consistent with a moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.  Some psammoma bodies are noted.  There is some evidence of treatment effect with replacement of tumour by dense fibrous tissue; there is between 10 and 50% tumour replacement by fibrous tissue.  \nBoth ovaries are identified in sections from the right and left adnexal tissues.  There is extensive tumour within adherent fibrous tissue on the surface ofboth ovaries but there is minimal tumour involvement of the deeper ovarian tissue.  Portions of both fallopian tubes are also identified in sections from both adnexa.  There is extensive tumour within soft tissue adherent to the outer surfaces of bothfallopian tubes.  One section from the fimbrial end of the right tube appears to show a focus of carcinoma in situ of residual tubal epithelium (block A20); the sections of residual fallopian tube are otherwise unremarkable.\nSections from the indurated segments of the rectosigmoid colon show extensive tumour within fibrofat adherent to the bowel serosa, andextending some distance into the underlying outer muscularis propria.  No tumour involvement of the bowel mucosa or submucosa is seen.  A total of nine lymph nodes were identified in the attached mesenteric fat and these are all free oftumour.  There is focal tumour involvement of the bowel serosa at the proximal excision margin.  \nB.  Sections show pieces of essentially unremarkable large intestinal wall.  No tumour is seen.  \nC.  Sections show omental fat with extensive involvement by poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.  There is minimal histologic evidence of treatment effect.  \nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.  Uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes and rectosigmoid colon:\n-  Moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving serosa and outer myometrium of uterus, serosa and outer muscularis propria of rectosigmoid colon, soft tissue adhesions between loops of rectosigmoid colon and posterior uterus, right and left parametrial soft tissues and serosa of ovaries and fallopian tubes.  Focal carcinoma in situ at fimbrial end of left tube.  \nB.  Proximal and distal bowel donuts:\n-  No tumour.  \nC.

Improved survival with vemurafenib in melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation.  N Engl J Med 2011; 364:2507-16). \nMethod:\n*DNA was extracted from FFPE tumour tissue using the Roche cobas DNA Sample Preparation kit.\n*BRAF gene mutations were analysed using the Roche cobas BRAF V600 Mutation Test kit (ARTG: 298901). \nCOMMENTS:\n*This test is intended as an adjunct to other prognostic and predictive factors to aid clinical treatment decisions. \n* This test does not specify the activating BRAF gene mutation that causes a substitution of the Valine at codon 600 (p.V600) of the BRAF protein. The test detects the common BRAF p.V600E (c.1799T>A) mutation, which occursin >80% of BRAF positive tumours, and may also detect some (but NOT all) activating BRAF p.V600K mutations, which occur in up to 17% of BRAF positive tumours. Other rare activating BRAF mutations affecting p.V600 may NOT be detected bythis analysis, therefore a negative result should be interpreted with caution. Other mutations, either in the BRAF gene or in other genes, will not be detected by this analysis. \n*This test has been shown in our laboratory to detect at least 5% mutant BRAF alleles in a background of normal DNA. Therefore a negative result should be interpreted with caution, as it does not exclude the presence of lowlevels of an activating BRAF mutation. \n*The analytical sensitivity and specificity of this test for the p.V600E mutation are 99.6% and 97.9%, respectively. PCR inhibitors or rare mutations affecting the binding sites of PCR primers and/or probes may cause a false negative result.\n*This test has been processed as a Level 1 genetic test according to the NPAAC guidelines (2007).\n*Only the testing performed byour laboratory is covered by NATA accreditation, not the referenced material used for clinical interpretation of this testing\". \n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "MEDICALRECORD: 2989019.BMQ\nPATIENT: MCCORKELL, ROBERT DONTE\nIDNUM: 29V90190\nDATE: 22/1/2063=>2063-01-22\nDATE: 21.1.63=>2063-01-21\nDOCTOR: ZB\nDOCTOR: UQ\nDATE: 8.1.63=>2063-01-08\nDOCTOR: H Luzuriaga\nDATE: 21.1.63=>2063-01-21\nDOCTOR: H Stricklind\nDEPARTMENT: ACT Genetic\nIDNUM: 298901\n"}]}

The tumour is 22mm from the 3 o&amp;apos;clock margin, 25mm from the 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin and abuts the deep margin.  30% of the tumour is possibly necrotic and there are areas of myxoid change.

See diagram.  (TO:YL/ec 29/10/71)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr L Kurokawa):\nSections show skin excised to include subcutaneous fat plus a small amount of underlying skeletal muscle. There is a lobulated and somewhat circumscribed cellular tumour centred in the subcutaneous fat. The tumour focally bulges into deep dermis. The superficial dermis, epidermis and skeletal muscle are uninvolved. The tumour is composed of compact fascicles of plump spindle cells with moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and one to two nucleoli. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen and focally number up to 4 per 10 HPF. Necrosis is not identified. There are moderate numbers of admixed inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils within the tumour. The tumour also shows nodular areas of hyalinisation and myxoid change associated with foamy histiocytes and haemosiderin laden macrophages. These alteration is regarded as treatment related changes and is seen in approximately 60% of the tumour. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.\n\nThe tumour cells show the following immunoprofile:\n-  Positive:  EMA.\n-  Equivocal:  S100 (scattered tumour cells, no more than 5%) and Melan A (faint cytoplasmic staining in around 1% of tumour cells).\n-  Negative:  MNF116, Cam5.2, CK5/6, SOX10, HMB45, MUM1, CD34, SMA, desmin, myogenin, STAT6, MUC4 and ALK.\nNuclear expression of H3K37m3 is retained.\nThe Ki-67 proliferation index is up to around 10% at hotspots by visual estimation.\n\nThe overall features are those of a malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.\n\nThe cellular tumour mass itself is 1 mm from the deep margin (Block 14). However, the tissue deep to the tumour has a paucicellular and loose myxoid appearance in which there are interspersed atypical cells . These cells may represent reactive atypia in benign stromal cells although tumour cells with treatment effect can show a similar cytology and as such, definite clearance of tumour at the deep margin cannot be guaranteed. This loose myxoid change is present at the deep margin over at least a 5 mm front (Blocks 13, 14 &amp;amp; 15). The tumour mass and deep loose myxoid stromal change are &amp;gt; 10 mm from all peripheral margins.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nExcision of lesion, right forearm (post radiotherapy):  Malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with treatment effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecimenReceivedDate\n2737-09-03 00:00:00\n\n\nLastName\nBrandler\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "DATE: 19940518=>1994-05-18\nHOSPITAL: WOOMERA HOSPITAL\nPATIENT: Lemuel\nIDNUM: 44X941529V\nMEDICALRECORD: 4499415\nPATIENT: Brodie\nDATE: 29/10/71=>2071-10-29\nDOCTOR: L Kurokawa\nTIME: 2737-09-03 00:00:00=>2737-09-03T00:00:00\nPATIENT: Brandler\n"}]}

There is a moderately to variable markedly cellular spindled to epithelioid/rhabdoid cell proliferation with scattered osteoclastic type and tumour giant cells. The cytoplasm is eosinophilic but no unequivocal striation is seen. There appears to be a variable abrupt transition from lower to widespread higher grade/pleomorphic areas (best seen in 6). The nuclei show variation in size with mostly intermediate to scattered marked pleomorphism. The nuclei are ovoid with irregular nuclear membranes, some coarse chromatin and some show distinct nucleoli. There are areas of more prominent thick collagen bundles in between the tumour, hyalinisation and coagulative and infarct type necrosis. Florid mitotic activity is seen (31mitoses/10HPF with field diameter 0.55mm) including some atypical forms. The scattered single more prominent atypical cells (up to 3 times the size of the average tumour cell combined with atypical mitoses and the small circumscribed area of increased atypia are best regarded a focal areas of anaplasia.\nThe peripheral 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin is best regarded as focally involved (3) at the level of subcutis and in another focus the 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin is less than 0.1mm away (6). The 3 o&amp;apos;clock peripheral margin is 4mm away.The deep margin is 1.6mm with an intact soft tissue plane (4). The other margins are further away.\nThe overlying skin shows moderate sun damage.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nThe tumour cells are diffusely positive for desmin (cytoplasmic). SMA shows patchy positive staining. Myogenin (nuclear) shows scattered single and small aggregates of positive cells. INI-1 shows retained nuclear staining. EMA shows scattered single cells with rather membranous staining. Pancytokeratin shows scattered small aggregates of staining\nThe tumour cells are negative for ERG, Sox10 and S100.\n\nThe morphological and immunohistochemical features show some similarity to the previous description in the core biopsy report from DHM. In the outside core biopsy Myogenin and Pancytokeratin were negative in contrast to the current excision however this may represent sampling.\n\nComment: The features are those of a rhabdomyosarcoma with some spindled areas including tumour giant cells and some sclerosis associated with focal anaplasia. The features are favoured to represent spindle cell/sclerosing type with patchy areas of pleomorphism over pleomorphic subtype.

The fallopian tubes are unremarkable.\n\nSections of the separate fragments of tissue consist of predominantly necrotic tumour including some fragments with a focal phyllodes-like growth pattern. There is a predominant stromal component (sarcomatous overgrowth). Some glands with columnar epithelium and with squamous metaplasia are identified. The stroma shows cytologic pleomorphism and increased cellularity with some subepithelial condensation. Multinucleated tumour giant cells are seen. Mitotic activity is present (up to 23 mitoses per 10 hpf).\n\n\nB. The sections show mesothelium with reactive changes and with macrophage and chronic inflammatory reaction of the stroma including and with acute inflammatory reaction.\n\nC. The sections show omentum with reactive surface epithelial change, mesothelial changes and macrophage reaction on the serosal surface\n\nComment: The appearances of the uterine tumour and separate fragments of tumour are those of adenosarcoma with sarcomatous overgrowth. It appears confined to the endometrium (stage 1A). There are also benign serous cystadenofibromas/serous inclusions  and endometriosis/serosal adhesions of the ovaries, and endometriosis/serosal adhesions of the posterior uterine serosa/pouch of douglas. Clinical correlation is recommended.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA. UTERUS\n- ADENOSARCOMA WITH SARCOMATOUS OVERGROWTH (STAGE 1A).\n\nB.

Right Pelvic Sidewall:\nSections show fatty connective tissue with an overlying layer of peritoneal mesothelium. The subsurface tissue is extensively involved by an infiltrative malignancy which has a predominantly cystic pseudoglandular architecture. The spaces are lined by large epithelial cells with moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei. The nuclei show variable atypia. There are some papillary structures present. In intervening stromal tissue there is a patchy chronic inflammatory infiltrate and there are some aggregates of foam cells. There are moderate numbers of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes. The subsurface epithelial proliferation merges with overlying mesothelial cells. Some cells contain cytoplasmic vacuoles.\n\nThe histologic features are consistent with MALIGNANT MESOTHELIOMA.\nSee specimen G for Immunohistochemistry.\nThere is deep invasion of subsurface fat by mesothelioma.\n\nB. Uterus, Bilateral Tubes And Ovaries:\n- Ectocervical mucosa is normal. Endocervical mucosa is normal. The endometrium is inactive and there is focal inactive adenomyosis present. There is a small intramural leiomyoma. The serosal/peritoneal surface of the uterus shows no abnormality.\n- The right ovary has some surface fibrous adhesions and small microcalcifications within granulation tissue. There is reactive mesothelial hyperplasia.\n- The right fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.\n- The left ovary shows areas of surface reactive mesothelial hyperplasia, and some small surface fibrous adhesions and granulation tissue. Within the granulation tissue, there are embedded aggregates of psammoma bodies.\n- The left fallopian tube shows no significant abnormality.\nTumour is not identified in this specimen.\n\nC. Right Diaphragmatic Wall:\nSections show fatty subperitoneal tissue with a surface layer of peritoneal mesothelium. There is a subsurface partly solid and partly cystic mass with a papillary, solid and pseudoglandular architecture of similar appearance to the tumour in specimen A (MESOTHELIOMA). The subsurface lesion has an invasive growth pattern and involves much of the specimen. The cells have a variable decidoid appearance. There is a stromal inflammatory infiltrate of small lymphocytes in areas and some xanthoma cells. Some psammoma bodies are present. There are moderate numbers of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes.  The tumour invades some attached skeletal muscle in one  section (C7). There is overlying mesothelial hyperplasia, fibrous adhesions and areas of granulation tissue and in some areas there are aggregates of psammoma bodies.\n\nD. Omentum:\nThe omental tissue contains deposits of MESOTHELIOMA.\n\nE. Appendices Epiploicae:\nSections show fatty tissue with MESOTHELIOMA. There are also some aggregates of foamy histiocytes and cholesterol crystals and moderate numbers of psammomatous calcifications.\n\nF. Left Pelvic Sidewall:\nSections show subperitoneal fatty tissue with subsurface involvement by MESOTHELIOMA.\nThere is deep invasion of subsurface fat.\n\nG. Left Anterior Abdominal Wall:\nSections show fatty tissue with involvement by MESOTHELIOMA. There is deep invasion of subsurface fat. There are some sheets of foamy histiocytes associated with the tumour and a patchy chronic inflammatory infiltrate of small lymphocytes and plasma cells. The tumour cells have a decidual appearance.\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY (IHC), block G2\nOther suitable block for testing: A2\nPositive: WT1, Podoplanin (D2-40), calretinin, CK5/6 (all 3+ positive)\nNegative: CD31, MOC-31, CEA, PAX8, ER, TTF1, CEA.\nBAP1: Immunohistochemical loss of nuclear staining\n\nCOMMENT on IHC:\nThe Immunohistochemical profile is consistent with mesothelioma. Immunohistochemical loss of nuclear BRCA-associated protein 1 (BAP1) is a highly specific marker of malignancy in mesothelial lesions.

Previous orchidectomy performed in New Zealand 15yrs ago.\nResult phoned to Surgical registrar by Dr J Stencel and Dr J Sacks at 12:15 on 12/1/21.\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr J Ernspiker):\nA. Paraffin embedded sections show fibrocollagenous tissue with patchy chronic inflammation and fat necrosis containing scattered islands of mature cartilage. A simple mucin lined ductule is also seen. In the clinical context of previous testicular tumour this is favoured to represent a focus of residual mature teratoma with treatment effect/fibrosis. There is no evidence of malignant germ cell tumour or sarcoma.\n\nB. Sections show aorta with surrounding peri-aortic tissue. There is extensive involvement of the fibrotic periaortic soft tissue by an infiltrative malignant sarcomatoid tumour. In the blocks submitted, the overall estimated maximum tumour dimension is 22mm (however, tumour is present at the margin and total tumour extent cannot be determined). The tumour is composed of malignant spindled to epithelioid cells arranged in dense cellular infiltrative sheets which dissect through periaortic fibrocollagen. In areas, the tumour cells appear to form malignant, anastomosing vascular channels lined by malignant hobnailed endothelial cells. The vasoformative tumour abuts and infiltrates into the adventitia and outer media of the aorta. Mitoses are readily identified and there are scattered foci of tumour necrosis. The tumour shows extensive crush type artefact and multifocal perineural involvement. The tumour extends broadly to the edges of the excision.\n\nFive lymph nodes are identified, one of which shows direct infiltration by tumour (1/5).\n\nImmunohistochemistry demonstrates positivity for vascular markers ERG, CD31 and CD34, as well as, BCL-2 (patchy), synaptophysin (weak),  Additional stains for inhibin, myogenin, LCA, WT1 (cytoplasm staining only), PLAP, AFP, desmin, tdt, pancytokeratin, CD56, SMA, TLE-1, MIC-2, CAM5.2, SOX-10 and OCT-34 are negative. INI-1 shows preserved (normal) nuclear staining.\n\nIn addition, within the surrounding fibrocollagenous and adipose tissue, there are occasional foci of cartilage on a background of broad nodules and sheets of dense organised fibrosis with  superimposed dystrophic calcification, fat necrosis and inflammation. Several entrapped medium to large nerves and ganglia are also seen. These background changes are suggestive of focal residual mature teratoma on a background of previous treatment related effect.\n\nC. Section show fibrocollagenous and adipose tissue showing fibrosis with superimposed patchy chronic inflammation and fat necrosis. No cartilage is seen. There is no evidence of malignancy.\n\nD. Sections show fibrocollagenous and adipose tissue showing fibrosis with superimposed patchy chronic inflammation and fat necrosis. A 1.1mm focus of adrenal cortical parenchyma, as well as, seven reactive appearing lymph nodes (0/7). No cartilage is seen. There is no evidence of malignancy.\n\nE. Section show fibrocollagenous and adipose tissue showing fibrosis with superimposed patchy chronic inflammation and fat necrosis. A single reactive lymph node is seen. No cartilage is identified. There is no evidence of malignancy.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe presence of islands of residual mature cartilage associated with organising fibrosis, inflammation, dystrophic calcification and fat necrosis in specimens A and B (para caval and peri aortic masses), is highly suggestive of residual mature teratoma on a background of treatment associated change. No evidence of malignant germ cell elements are seen.\n\nAs reported in the previous biopsy by Professor Jaussen, there is an associated peri-aortic high grade malignant sarcoma, which may represent: (a) malignant transformation arising within the previously treated para-aortic tumour; (b) or, a de novo sarcoma. In these specimens, the high grade sarcoma demonstrates malignant vasoformative morphology, as well as, strong diffuse staining with endothelial markers, consistent with a high grade angiosarcoma.\nSarcoma is present at margins.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA. Para-caval mass: Favour residual mature teratoma with treatment effects. No evidence of malignant germ cell tumour, sarcoma or malignancy.\n\nB. Peri-aortic tumour:\n- Malignant vasoformative tumour, consistent with high grade angiosarcoma, present at margins.\n- One of five lymph nodes shows direct invasion by angiosarcoma.\n- Background nodular organised fibrosis and dystrophic calcification ?treatment related change.\n\nC.

(TO:LR/ta/ta 4/6/71)\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr R Rehder):\nA. The specimen is entirely embedded and examined. Sections show dense fibrous tissue, a small amount of fibroadipose connective tissue and a small focus of ovarian tissue. In areas the fibrous tissue is surfaced mesothelium and there is patchy surface mesothelial surface reaction, subserosal fibrosis associated and subacute haemorrhage in the form of hemosiderin laden macrophages. A small focus of subserosal tumour is present (A7, A8). The tumour is composed of epitheloid cells with moderately pleomorphic round to oval nuclei, mostly conspicuous nucleoli and a small to moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumour cells are arranged in a loosely cohesive aggregates associated with an infiltrative small lymphocytes. Gland formation and slit- like architecture is not seen. The morphological appearance is similar to those seen in the remaining specimens.\n\nB. Sections of uterus show a focus of subserosal high grade serous carcinoma involving the subserosa of the anterior uterine body (B1). The morphology as described previously. The myometrium shows numerous fibroids including subserosal and calcified fibroids.\nThere is a benign endometrial polyp and the endometrium is otherwise inactive.\n\nThe ectocervix is unremarkable and uninvolved. The endocervix shows conspicuous Nabothian cysts.\n\nThe fallopian tubes are serially sectioned and entirely embedded and examined.\nThe ovaries are entirely embedded and examined. High grade serous carcinoma  multifocally involves the right ovarian serosa and subserosa as well as right paraovarian soft tissues (B16 to B22).  High grade serous carcinoma  also involves the serosa and subserosa of the left ovary (B23 to B25), the left fallopian tube and right fallopian tube  (eg B26, B30, B11 to B14). No evidence of serous intraepithelial carcinoma in situ (STIC) is seen. There is a probable small focus of endometriosis in the right ovary (B18).\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive: CK7, PAX 8, WT1, P53 (mutation pattern with diffuse strong expression), Ber-EP4, P16 (diffuse), ER near diffuse strong, HBME-1 (patchy).\nNegative: Calretinin, CK5/6, CK20, SATB2, CDX2.\n\nThe immunoprofile is consistent with high grade serous carcinoma.\n\nC.

The tumour consists of infiltrative sheets of poorly differentiated malignant cells with variable epithelioid to spindled morphology. The epithelioid appearing tumour cells have mild to moderate amounts of eosinophilic (focally rhabdoid) cytoplasm. The tumour cell nuclei appear epithelioid to spindled with moderate pleomorphism, round to angulated irregular nuclear membranes and hyperchromasia. Nuclei overlap and touch in areas. In block A16, a focus of markedly atypical bizarre epithelioid tumour cells is seen. Mitoses are readily identified throughout and there are broad sheets and serpiginous foci of tumour necrosis and haemorrhage (with focal dystrophic calcification and scattered cholesterol clefts). Tumour sheets appear separated by variably thick fibrous septae and whilst there are infiltrative foci that extend directly into adipose tissue, much of the tumour deposit appears surrounded by a fibrous pseudocapsule. Whilst the tumour deposit is a presumed lymph node metastasis, underlying nodal tissue is essentially completely effaced. Tumour is at least 0.45mm from the surgical margin (A19). The overlying skin shows no significant abnormality. One separate lymph node shows effacement by necrosis (without involvement by tumour) and eighteen additional lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/18).\n\nImmunohistochemical stains were performed and the results are as follows:\nTumour cells positive for: CAM5.2 (perinuclear dot like), desmin (perinuclear dot like), CD56, BCL-6\nTumour cells negative for: S100, SOX10, synaptophysin, STAT6, CK20, chromogranin, MITF, MIC2, SMA, LCA, CD34, HMB45, MelanA and BCL-6.\nA ki-67 is high (greater than 80%).\nAdditional stains performed in 2070 not repeated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe 80mm left axillary tumour is a deposit of metastatic (high grade) poorly differentiated malignancy.\n\nThe previous history is noted:\n- 2002: External slides reviewed at CONDOBOLIN RETIREMENT VILLAGE (ZM-64-317032) of right upper arm subcutaneous lump which was diagnosed as a monophasic synovial sarcoma.\n- 2013: Skin lesion excised from back and the tissue is examined at HAWKER MEMORIAL HOSPITAL (ZM-64-317032). A diagnosis of superficial spreading melanoma (Breslow thickness 0.5 mm, Clark level III) with a predominance of naevoid cells was made.\n- 2017: Subtotal colectomy at TOTTENHAM HOSPITAL (94P43170) for caecal adenocarcinoma, pT3 N1a Mx R0.\n- 2018: Liver segmental resection at LONG JETTY HEALTH CARE FACILITY (94P43170) for metastatic adenocarcinoma consistent with colorectal primary.\n- 2020: Left axillary and right femoral reaming biopsies: Poorly differentiated malignancy with necrosis; variable cytokeratin, SOX10, S100 positivity; SSYT negative - favour metastatic melanoma, cannot exclude metastatic sarcoma or sarcomatoid carcinoma.\n\nThe previous left axillary and right femoral reaming biopsies have been reviewed and show overlapping histopathologic features and morphologic similarity to the current 80mm left axillary lesion. Whilst no demonstrable SOX10 or S100 staining is seen in this current excision, there is persisting positive cytokeratin, desmin and CD56 staining. BRAF, CK14, GFAP and K3K27me3 remain outstanding (other stains performed in 2070 have not been repeated).\n\nOverall, the 80mm left axillary deposit is a poorly differentiated high grade malignancy. Whilst there are similarities in morphology between the recently reported left axillary biopsy, femoral reaming biopsy and this current left axillary excision, there are some differences in the overall pattern of immunohistochemical staining in the tumours, making definitive classification difficult. However, following intra-departmental review, an overall pathologic differential diagnosis is thought to include: a dedifferentiated malignant melanoma; poorly differentiated carcinoma/neuroendocrine carcinoma; poorly differentiated myoepithelial carcinoma, as well as, a malignant sarcomatoid tumour (eg. MPNST). Given that classification of this tumour is difficult and there remains some uncertainy, the case (and previous biopsies from 2070) will be sent to Professor DYLAN RASHID for an additional opinion.\n\nB. Sections of the three level three lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/3).\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA. Left axillary dissection:\n- 80mm deposit of poorly differentiated malignancy (difficult to subclassify and sent for additional opinion from Professor Pat).\n- One additional lymph node effaced by necrosis only and 18 reactive appearing lymph nodes.\n- Margin appears clear of tumour (0.45mm).\n\nB.

(TO:DN/ec 5/4/71)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr N Dellasciucca):\nSections show a well circumscribed hypocellular myxoid lesion.  The tumour is composed of bland spindle cells surrounded by abundant myxoid stroma.  The slender spindle cells are relatively uniform with no significant cytological atypia or mitotic activity.  The cellularity of lesion is relatively evenly distributed and the cellularity appears to be higher than usual myxoma.  The periphery is slightly more cellular with collagenized capsule.  At periphery, the tumour infiltrates into the surrounding striated muscle.  No lipoblasts are seen.  There is scant blood vessels.  The matrix is slightly basophilic matrix with a few mucinous cysts.  The spindle cells are positive for CD34 and Vimentin.  The stains for S100, SOX10, EMA, SMA, Desmin, Myogenin, MUC4 and ALK are negative.  The overall appearances are consistent with those of intramuscular myxoma.  Because of the increased cellularity, the tumour is best to be classified as a cellular myxoma.  The tumour is completely excised.  In several locations, the tumour is separated from the resection margin by a thin layer of fibrous tissue.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nRight gluteal tumour - Cellular myxoma (intramuscular).\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 52L452761P\nMEDICALRECORD: 5244527\nHOSPITAL: BOOROWA MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE HOSPITAL\nDOCTOR: N Lindow\nDATE: 5/4/71=>2071-05-04\nDOCTOR: N Dellasciucca\n"}]}

The oriented excision of markedly sun damaged skin to subcutis and skeletal muscle shows residual incompletely excised High grade sarcoma adjacent to a scar.\n\nThe tumour is located mostly in the deep aspect of the specimen tracking within the skeletal muscle and deep to the subcutis within fascia like dense fibrous tissue and focally extends into the dermis.\n\nThere is a variable appearance of the tumour. In most areas there is a more exansile circumscribed high grade component. It is moderate to marked cellular with a spindled to epithelioid appearance. The nuclear are irregular in shape, hyprochromatic and without any nucleoli. Mitoses including atypical forms are easily identified (38 mitoses/10HPF). There are widespread intermixed osteoclastic-type giant cells, haemorrhage and hemosiderophages in between the atypical tumour cells. Some geographic necrosis is present.\n\nThere is also a more low grade component lacking the osteoclastic giant cells and comprises more mildly to moderately atypical single spindle cells (13, 16 -22, 25).These neoplastic atypical cells track widely beyond the expansile high grade nodules along the fibrous septa. Focal haemosiderin is associated with it.\n\nThe morpholgy is similar to the previous excision (00I57282). At that time the tumour showed also a heterogeneous appearance. In the current excision there are also occasional mildly atypical stromal cells which at times are difficult to distinguish between neoplastic and reactive due to adjuvant therapy. No immunohistochemistry has been repeated.\n\nThere is no lymphovascular invasion and a couple of nerves are overrun, however no convincing perineural invasion is seen.\n\nThe high grade component with the multinucleated giant cell extends broadly towards the deep margin in numerous sections examined including up to the edge to the 9 o&amp;apos;clock peripheral margin (9). The 6 o&amp;apos;clock peripheral margin is involved by the low grade component (24, 25). The more superficial peripheral 12 o&amp;apos;clock, 3 o&amp;apos;clock and 9 o&amp;apos;clock margins appears clear by at least 5mm.\n\nB.

(TO:DN/ta 27/5/71)\nMICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr I Taub &amp;amp; Dr I Boerger)\nSections of the 170mm left posterior arm lesion show a malignant spindle cell sarcoma. The tumour has a predominant pushing advancing edge with a variably thick fibrous pseudocapsule. There is a surrounding cuff of mature fibradipose tissue and skeletal muscle. The tumour is moderately to highly cellular and is composed of malignant plump to anaplastic spindled cells arranged in herringbone and peritheliomatous patterns. At the centre of the lesion, there is extensive suppurative necrosis (with up to 85% of tumour appearing necrotic). Up to 16 mitoses per 10 hpf are seen. At the interface between viable and necrotic tumour, the tumour appears less cellular with a haphazard arrangement of the malignant spindled cells. The residual tumour shows features consistent with previous treatment (fibrinoid necrosis of vessels with superimposed myxohyaline change, inflammation and extensive necrosis as previously described). The overlying shows reactive changes.\n\nThe margins of excision are as follows:\nProximal: Clear of tumour (at least 10mm) (1)\nDistal: 3.3mm (16)\nMedial: 4mm (2)\nLateral: 3.3mm (12)\nDeep: 5mm (7)\nSuperficial (distal end - no overlying skin): 2.2mm (15)\n\n\nIMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:\nTumour cells positive for: Pancytokeratin (focal ?aberrant), P40 (focal ?aberrant), CD34 (patchy cytoplasmic staining).\nTumour cells negative for: TLE1 (focal non-specific), CAM5.2, CD31, STAT6, myogenin, desmin (focal non-specific), CD99 (non-specific), SMA, S100 and SOX10.\nH3K27me3 shows loss of nuclear staining in most tumour cells (&amp;gt;85%).\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe 170mm posterior arm lesion is a high grade spindled/sarcomatoid malignancy. The appearance is similar to that described in the recent core biopsy (DHM 14171-21MP Dr Scheel) including loss of H3K27me3. However, no demonstrable S100, SOX10 or smooth/skeletal muscle staining is seen.\n\nOverall, the findings support the original preferred diagnosis of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumour. There is no definitive rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation.\n\nGrading of sarcomas may not be reliable after treatment, however, in the material examined the overall features would be in keeping with FNCLCC grade 3 (high grade).\n(Tumour score = 3; mitosis score = 2; necrosis = 2; total score = 7/8).\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nLeft posterior arm: 170mm high grade spindled/sarcomatoid malignancy, clear of margins (see comment).\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 37W447669F\nMEDICALRECORD: 37844766\nHOSPITAL: YARRAWONGA HEALTH\nDOCTOR: I Duartes\nDOCTOR: I Bergren\nDATE: 27/5/71=>2071-05-27\nDOCTOR: I Taub\nDOCTOR: I Boerger\nDOCTOR: Scheel\n"}]}

Sections show fibrous tissue and fat with a circumscribed atypical spindle cell lesion. The lesion is moderately cellular, and is composed of spindle shaped tumour cells with elongated, plump, hyperchromatic nuclei, within myxoid stroma. Thin walled vessels are seen in the background. Scattered  tumour cells with large pleomorphic nuclei are seen. Tumour cells with intracytoplasmic vacuoles displacing the nuclei and occasional mitoses are seen. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is present.\n\nPositive staining is seen for EMA, CD34, and SMA. Patchy staining is seen for S100. Rare cells show positive staining for neurofilament. SOX10 (performed twice) is negative. PanCK, desmin, melan A, desmin, MUC4, CD99, GLUT1, TLE1, HMB45, stat-6 and c-kit are negative. INI-1 and H3K27me3 are retained.

There is a moderately to variable markedly cellular spindled to epithelioid/rhabdoid cell proliferation with scattered osteoclastic type and tumour giant cells. The cytoplasm is eosinophilic but no unequivocal striation is seen. There appears to be a variable abrupt transition from lower to widespread higher grade/pleomorphic areas (best seen in 6). The nuclei show variation in size with mostly intermediate to scattered marked pleomorphism. The nuclei are ovoid with irregular nuclear membranes, some coarse chromatin and some show distinct nucleoli. There are areas of more prominent thick collagen bundles in between the tumour, hyalinisation and coagulative and infarct type necrosis. Florid mitotic activity is seen (31mitoses/10HPF with field diameter 0.55mm) including some atypical forms. The scattered single more prominent atypical cells (up to 3 times the size of the average tumour cell combined with atypical mitoses and the small circumscribed area of increased atypia are best regarded a focal areas of anaplasia.\nThe peripheral 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin is best regarded as focally involved (3) at the level of subcutis and in another focus the 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin is less than 0.1mm away (6). The 3 o&amp;apos;clock peripheral margin is 4mm away.The deep margin is 1.6mm with an intact soft tissue plane (4). The other margins are further away.\nThe overlying skin shows moderate sun damage.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nThe tumour cells are diffusely positive for desmin (cytoplasmic). SMA shows patchy positive staining. Myogenin (nuclear) shows scattered single and small aggregates of positive cells. INI-1 shows retained nuclear staining. EMA shows scattered single cells with rather membranous staining. Pancytokeratin shows scattered small aggregates of staining\nThe tumour cells are negative for ERG, Sox10 and S100.\n\nThe morphological and immunohistochemical features show some similarity to the previous description in the core biopsy report from DHM. In the outside core biopsy Myogenin and Pancytokeratin were negative in contrast to the current excision however this may represent sampling.\n\nComment: The features are those of a rhabdomyosarcoma with some spindled areas including tumour giant cells and some sclerosis associated with focal anaplasia. The features are favoured to represent spindle cell/sclerosing type with patchy areas of pleomorphism over pleomorphic subtype.

The mesocolon/retroperitoneum shows widespread Well differentiated Liposarcoma.\n\nThe tumour is present throughout the blocks and shows mostly a lipomatous differentiation and smaller foci of sclerosing subtype (A43) and myxoid appearance. The tumour comprises predominantly adipose tissue with some areas showing fibrous septae. There are atypical nuclei in the adipose tissue including variation in size of adipocytes and septae including focal single multinucleated bizarre cells.. Lipoblasts are easily identified. There is abrupt transition to myxoid nodules (as seen macroscopically) and slow transition of more myxoid stroma. There are distinct nodules of sclerosing subtype (as seen macroscopically as nodules). Mitoses are very inconspiciuous. Small foci of fat necrosis are seen but there is no coagulative/tumour necrosis. There is no lymphovascular and no perineural invasion. The tumour extends to the stroma external to the muscularis propria of the colon in Specimen A but does not invade the muscularis propria. The stromal margins are involved and the colonic peripheral margins clear.

The testis shows Leydig cell hyperplasia and age-related changes.  There is a region of fibrosis associated with an organising haematoma and focal haemosiderin deposition in keeping with previous surgery.  In addition, there are small numbers of dispersed atypical spindle to stellate cells with enlarged hyperchromatic and irregular nuclei.  These atypical cells are seen throughout the entirety of the specimen.  The background stroma has a fibrous to myxoid appearance.  In areas, the adipocytes show a mild degree of variation in cell sizes.  The histology is consistent with a well-differentiated liposarcoma with mixed lipoma-like and sclerosing features.\n\nThe atypical cells extends to the spermatic cord shave margin as well as the deep margin focally.  Assessment of clearance amongst the rest of the margins is difficult due to the subtle cell size variation amongst the adipocytes and the sparsely distributed nature of the atypical cells.  Recognising this limitation, the excision margins are summarised as follows:\n-  Spermatic cord margin:  Involved by tumour (Block 1).\n-  Superficial:  3 mm (Block 27).\n-  Deep:  Involved by tumour (Block 19).\n-  Superior:  &amp;gt; 10 mm.\n-  Inferior:  6 mm (Block 55).\n-  Medial:  1 mm (Blocks 41 &amp;amp; 42).\n-  Lateral:  2 mm (Blocks 39 &amp;amp; 50).\nThe overlying skin is uninvolved.

See diagram.  (TO:YL/ec 29/10/71)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Kuligowski):\nSections show skin excised to include subcutaneous fat plus a small amount of underlying skeletal muscle. There is a lobulated and somewhat circumscribed cellular tumour centred in the subcutaneous fat. The tumour focally bulges into deep dermis. The superficial dermis, epidermis and skeletal muscle are uninvolved. The tumour is composed of compact fascicles of plump spindle cells with moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and one to two nucleoli. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen and focally number up to 4 per 10 HPF. Necrosis is not identified. There are moderate numbers of admixed inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils within the tumour. The tumour also shows nodular areas of hyalinisation and myxoid change associated with foamy histiocytes and haemosiderin laden macrophages. These alteration is regarded as treatment related changes and is seen in approximately 60% of the tumour. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.\n\nThe tumour cells show the following immunoprofile:\n-  Positive:  EMA.\n-  Equivocal:  S100 (scattered tumour cells, no more than 5%) and Melan A (faint cytoplasmic staining in around 1% of tumour cells).\n-  Negative:  MNF116, Cam5.2, CK5/6, SOX10, HMB45, MUM1, CD34, SMA, desmin, myogenin, STAT6, MUC4 and ALK.\nNuclear expression of H3K37m3 is retained.\nThe Ki-67 proliferation index is up to around 10% at hotspots by visual estimation.\n\nThe overall features are those of a malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.\n\nThe cellular tumour mass itself is 1 mm from the deep margin (Block 14). However, the tissue deep to the tumour has a paucicellular and loose myxoid appearance in which there are interspersed atypical cells . These cells may represent reactive atypia in benign stromal cells although tumour cells with treatment effect can show a similar cytology and as such, definite clearance of tumour at the deep margin cannot be guaranteed. This loose myxoid change is present at the deep margin over at least a 5 mm front (Blocks 13, 14 &amp;amp; 15). The tumour mass and deep loose myxoid stromal change are &amp;gt; 10 mm from all peripheral margins.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nExcision of lesion, right forearm (post radiotherapy):  Malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with treatment effect\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 48M853766S\nMEDICALRECORD: 4848537\nHOSPITAL: GOULBURN BASE HOSPITAL\nDATE: 29/10/71=>2071-10-29\nDOCTOR: M Kuligowski\n"}]}

Sections show fragments of apparently subcapsular liver with fibrosis and chronic inflammation without fibrous tissue and bile ducts within fibrous tissue.  Negative for malignancy.\nC.  Sections of both macroscopically identified tumour masses have similar morrphology.  The appearances are those of diffuse type gastric carcinoma (poorly cohesive carcinoma) including signet ring cells. There is a wide variation in the morphology of tumour cells including some with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, some with increased nucleus to cytoplasm ratio, some with vacuolated cytoplasm and some with targetoid intracytoplasmic inclusions. In addition there are foci of squamous differentiation identified including rare intercellular bridges and these are positive for CK5/6 and p-40. The squamous differentiation form less than 25% of the tumour volume (and hence does not fulfil criteria given by some authors for a diagnosis of adenosquamous carcinoma). The diffuse gastric carcinoma is positive for CK20 (strong diffuse), focal CK7, and strong diffuse E-cadherin.\nThere is prominent lymphatic vascular space invasion.\nBoth macroscopic tumour masses  involve the full thickness of the gastric wall to reach the adjacent serosa and with infiltration of the immediately adjacent greater omentum.  Sections of the stomach in between the two main tumour masses show lymphatic permeation by carcinoma as well as deposits of infiltrative carcinoma within the submucosa.  It is likely that one of the macroscopic tumour masses represents intragastric spread of the other tumour.\nCarcinoma is 12mm from the proximal resection margin and is not seen in the sections from the distal resection margin.\nThere is patchy chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa. Giemsa stain is negative for Helicobacter. No intestinal metaplasia is seen in the sections examined.\n8 of 8 lesser curve lymph nodes show metastatic carcinoma.\n8 of 8 greater curve lymph nodes show metastatic carcinoma.\n4 of 4 splenic hilar lymph nodes show metastatic carcinoma.\nSections of the spleen are unremarkable and sections of the pancreas are unremarkable.\nSections of the fallopian tubes and ovaries are unremarkable.

There is a 105 x 82mm overlying triangular excision of skin with a 31mm vertical bilateral iatrogenic linear defect.  A suture is present as described.  Medial inked blue, lateral inked green, deep inked black, cord inked yellow.  Sampled for biobank.  Shave of spermatic cord taken and false margin inked red.  The specimen is serially sliced (superior to inferior) into fifteen slices.  The testicle is seen in slices fourteen and fifteen measuring 25 x 30 x 25mm.  On sectioning there is a haemorrhagic cavity seen in slices eleven to thirteen, 25 x 15 x 30mm.

Shown to Dr N Skartvedt.  Photograph available.  (TO:DN/ta 15/10/71)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr N Sacchi):\nSections show skin with underlying testis and surrounding fatty tissue.  The testis shows Leydig cell hyperplasia and age-related changes.  There is a region of fibrosis associated with an organising haematoma and focal haemosiderin deposition in keeping with previous surgery.  In addition, there are small numbers of dispersed atypical spindle to stellate cells with enlarged hyperchromatic and irregular nuclei.  These atypical cells are seen throughout the entirety of the specimen.  The background stroma has a fibrous to myxoid appearance.  In areas, the adipocytes show a mild degree of variation in cell sizes.  The histology is consistent with a well-differentiated liposarcoma with mixed lipoma-like and sclerosing features.\n\nThe atypical cells extends to the spermatic cord shave margin as well as the deep margin focally.  Assessment of clearance amongst the rest of the margins is difficult due to the subtle cell size variation amongst the adipocytes and the sparsely distributed nature of the atypical cells.  Recognising this limitation, the excision margins are summarised as follows:\n-  Spermatic cord margin:  Involved by tumour (Block 1).\n-  Superficial:  3 mm (Block 27).\n-  Deep:  Involved by tumour (Block 19).\n-  Superior:  &amp;gt; 10 mm.\n-  Inferior:  6 mm (Block 55).\n-  Medial:  1 mm (Blocks 41 &amp;amp; 42).\n-  Lateral:  2 mm (Blocks 39 &amp;amp; 50).\nThe overlying skin is uninvolved.

The tumour deposits are characterised by abundant extracellular mucin with numerous small nests and acini formed by cells with mild to moderate nuclear atypia and features reminiscent of goblet cell carcinoid. No single signet ring cells are seen. Four small mesenteric and mesocolic lymph nodes are identified which do not contain deposits of tumour.  Immunostains show positivity for CK20 and synpatophysin, CK7 and chromogranin are negative. However Ki67 is high at &amp;gt;80% which is way beyond that acceptable for goblet cell carcinoid and therefore the current deposits are best considered as moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.

These deposits take the form of strips of mucinous epitheliumwhich in most areas show low-grade nuclear features. In some areas, there are  intermediate nuclear features, including nuclear hyperchromasia, focal pseudeostratification, prominent nucleoli, and occasional mitotic figures. Architecture is simple, with a few papillae seen focally, but no cribriform architecture. There are multiple deposits of extracellular mucin containing strips of low to intermediate grade mucinous epithelium on the peritoneal surface. At the area of macroscopically ulcerated mucosa, similar tumour is seen within the mucosa and submucosa, with focal ulceration. A few foci of desmoplastic stromal reaction are seen in response to foci of atypical epithelium and a few irregular glands. In the sections of skin, mucinous tumour is seen within the dermis and subcutis (Block 7). Sections of the bowel wall on either side of the anastomosis show viable small intestine and colonic wall. Sections of the long segment of bowel wall show serosal deposits of low to intermediate grade mucinous tumour. Two small lymph nodes show no involvement.\nComment: The most likely primary site would be appendix, however many other primary sites are possible, and clinical correlation is required.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nCOLON AND PERITONEAL DISEASE:\n- MULTIFOCAL, PREDOMINANTLY PERITONEAL INVOLVEMENT BY LOW TO INTERMEDIATE GRADE MUCINOUS NEOPLASM.

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Bready):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr M Penrod who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Miquel comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

There is a tumour arising from the transverse colon which is circumferential with polypoid raised edges and necrotic centre, approximately measuring 80x50mm. This tumour is involving the wall to extensively involve the overlying serosa. There is extensive involvement of the adjacent omentum and the mesentery and the wall of the adjacent distal segment of the transverse colon. This distal involvement appears to be involving the wall to reach the mucosal surface which is nodular in the distal, 80mm of the specimen, to involve the distal margin. Otherwise, the main tumour is located 40mm of the proximal margin and abuts the radial surgical resection margin macroscopically. The attached dilated segment of bowel has multiple white serosal  nodules with no mucosal involvement.

There is diffuse positive staining for CK7.  The tumour is negative for CDX2 and shows mostly negative staining for CK20 with a few islands of positive cells.\nThere is negative staining with GATA3, TTF1, PAX8, D2-40, Chromogranin, synaptophysin, and WT1.  Calretining shows diffuse weak staining ?non-specific.\n\nMismatch repair enzymes immunohistochemistry: to follow.\n\nSynthesis/stage (AJCC/UICC TNM 7):\n\nTNM stage:  pT4a pN2b pM1b pR1\n\nComments:\nThe tumour shows poorly differentiated morphology with occasional extracellular mucin, occasional signet ring forms and mostly sheets of high-grade non-descript tumour cells.  It appears to be located mostly in the submucosa and undermines the mucosa, with occasional tongues extending up and rupturing through the mucosal surface.  There is extensive serosal involvement.  The immunostaining pattern is unusual and may represent the effect of chemotherapy. The loss of CDX2 and CK20 and gain of CK7 in colorectal carcinoma has been described in the literature and is associated with poor prognosis (Loss of CDX2 expression is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients. Bae JM et al. World J Gastroenterol 2015 February 7; 21(5): 1457-1467). I am not entirely able to exclude a metastasis on morphology and immunohistochemistry, as similar features can be seen in adenocarcinomas of the upper gastrointestinal tract.  I have requested the original biopsy slide and block for comparison.  A supplementary report will be issued.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nOMENTUM AND TRANSVERSE COLON:\n- POORLY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA, pT4a pN2b pM1b pR1\n- EXTENSIVE LYMPHOVASCULAR INVASION\n- MARGINS POSITIVE FOR TUMOUR\n- INVOLVES FOURTEEN LYMPH NODES (14/14)\n19/12/2066 ank\nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (22/12/2066):\nThe original biopsy case has been reviewed (29Q7229, 20/3/2066, Clinical labs).  The tumour in the biopsy has the same morphology as the tumour in the main resection specimen, and both show the same immunohistochemical profile (both are negative for CDX2, patchy positive for CK7 and CK20, negative for all other markers).

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Yohe):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr V Bognar who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Lucius comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

However, there is no full appendiceal wall thickness perforation in the sections examined.\nThere is extensive intra-abdominal low grade mucinous neoplasm. There are deposits of tumour involving the mesentery of the large bowel, the serosal surface of the large bowel, small bowel, stomach, gallbladder, spleen and li ver. There is extensive involvement of omental fat. The deposits are characterised by extensive extracellular mucin and of moderate cellularity characterised by strips of mucinous epithelium with low to intermediate nuclear grade. No high  grade epithelial changes are seen, and no frankly infiltrative architecture is seen.\nRepresentative sections of the distal (unstapled) margin of the partial gastrectomy show a 10mm neuroendocrine tumour. The tumour infiltra tes from the base of the mucosa, through partial but not full thickness muscularis propria. Tumour is characterised by trabecular and gyriformform architecture and is mitotically inactive. Immunostains including Ki-67 are pending and a fu rther report will follow.

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Baitner):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr W Schied who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Shannon comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

There is a lobulated and somewhat circumscribed cellular tumour centred in the subcutaneous fat. The tumour focally bulges into deep dermis. The superficial dermis, epidermis and skeletal muscle are uninvolved. The tumour is composed of compact fascicles of plump spindle cells with moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and one to two nucleoli. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen and focally number up to 4 per 10 HPF. Necrosis is not identified. There are moderate numbers of admixed inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils within the tumour. The tumour also shows nodular areas of hyalinisation and myxoid change associated with foamy histiocytes and haemosiderin laden macrophages. These alteration is regarded as treatment related changes and is seen in approximately 60% of the tumour. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.\n\nThe tumour cells show the following immunoprofile:\n-  Positive:  EMA.\n-  Equivocal:  S100 (scattered tumour cells, no more than 5%) and Melan A (faint cytoplasmic staining in around 1% of tumour cells).\n-  Negative:  MNF116, Cam5.2, CK5/6, SOX10, HMB45, MUM1, CD34, SMA, desmin, myogenin, STAT6, MUC4 and ALK.\nNuclear expression of H3K37m3 is retained.\nThe Ki-67 proliferation index is up to around 10% at hotspots by visual estimation.\n\nThe overall features are those of a malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.\n\nThe cellular tumour mass itself is 1 mm from the deep margin (Block 14). However, the tissue deep to the tumour has a paucicellular and loose myxoid appearance in which there are interspersed atypical cells . These cells may represent reactive atypia in benign stromal cells although tumour cells with treatment effect can show a similar cytology and as such, definite clearance of tumour at the deep margin cannot be guaranteed. This loose myxoid change is present at the deep margin over at least a 5 mm front (Blocks 13, 14 &amp;amp; 15). The tumour mass and deep loose myxoid stromal change are &amp;gt; 10 mm from all peripheral margins.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nExcision of lesion, right forearm (post radiotherapy):  Malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with treatment effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecimenReceivedDate\n2737-09-03 00:00:00\n\n\nLastName\nVibert\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "DATE: 19940518=>1994-05-18\nHOSPITAL: BENALLA HEALTH\nPATIENT: Jessie\nIDNUM: 32J015881C\nMEDICALRECORD: 3230158\nPATIENT: Lamar\nDATE: 29/10/71=>2071-10-29\nDOCTOR: J Carrales\nTIME: 2737-09-03 00:00:00=>2737-09-03T00:00:00\nPATIENT: Vibert\n"}]}

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Capitano):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr W Vaneekelen who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Erasmo comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

RS (M-6/LK/ank)\n\nMICROSCOPIC:   (Dr. L Sperow)\nSections show adipose tissue extensively infiltrated by a clear cell tumour.  The tumour has a predominantly papillary growth pattern, but also shows areas of tubular growth pattern.  There are scattered psammoma bodies present.  The papillary cores in some areas have a hyalinised appearance.  In some areas, eosinophilic material is seen within the tubular structures.  Individual tumour cells have abundant clear cytoplasm, and irregular nuclei with some nuclear membrane folding, and small nucleoli.  There is little or no nuclear stratification in most areas.  Mitotic figures are extremely sparse (less than 1 per 10 high power fields).  Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumour is positive for EMA, PAX8, Ber-EP4, CK7, and HBME-1.  It shows very weak variable focal positivity for p53, and very focal positivity for Napsin A.  It is negative for WT1, cytokeratin 20, calretinin, CEA, p16, AMACR, and D-240.\nThis case has been subject to intradepartmental consultation.  The appearances raise a differential diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma versus serous carcinoma.

In the centre of the excision is a 50 x 43mm nodule.  Skeletal muscle is present on the deep surface.  3 o&amp;apos;clock inked blue and 9 o&amp;apos;clock inked black.  Specimen is sectioned from proximal to distal into nine slices.  There is a lobulated tan tumour 55 x 45 x 25mm.  The tumour is 22mm from the 3 o&amp;apos;clock margin, 25mm from the 9 o&amp;apos;clock margin and abuts the deep margin.  30% of the tumour is possibly necrotic and there are areas of myxoid change.

See diagram.  (TO:YL/ec 29/10/71)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr O Braddy):\nSections show skin excised to include subcutaneous fat plus a small amount of underlying skeletal muscle. There is a lobulated and somewhat circumscribed cellular tumour centred in the subcutaneous fat. The tumour focally bulges into deep dermis. The superficial dermis, epidermis and skeletal muscle are uninvolved. The tumour is composed of compact fascicles of plump spindle cells with moderate amounts of lightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, enlarged nuclei and one to two nucleoli. Mitotic figures are occasionally seen and focally number up to 4 per 10 HPF. Necrosis is not identified. There are moderate numbers of admixed inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils within the tumour. The tumour also shows nodular areas of hyalinisation and myxoid change associated with foamy histiocytes and haemosiderin laden macrophages. These alteration is regarded as treatment related changes and is seen in approximately 60% of the tumour. No lymphovascular or perineural invasion is seen.\n\nThe tumour cells show the following immunoprofile:\n-  Positive:  EMA.\n-  Equivocal:  S100 (scattered tumour cells, no more than 5%) and Melan A (faint cytoplasmic staining in around 1% of tumour cells).\n-  Negative:  MNF116, Cam5.2, CK5/6, SOX10, HMB45, MUM1, CD34, SMA, desmin, myogenin, STAT6, MUC4 and ALK.\nNuclear expression of H3K37m3 is retained.\nThe Ki-67 proliferation index is up to around 10% at hotspots by visual estimation.\n\nThe overall features are those of a malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma.\n\nThe cellular tumour mass itself is 1 mm from the deep margin (Block 14). However, the tissue deep to the tumour has a paucicellular and loose myxoid appearance in which there are interspersed atypical cells . These cells may represent reactive atypia in benign stromal cells although tumour cells with treatment effect can show a similar cytology and as such, definite clearance of tumour at the deep margin cannot be guaranteed. This loose myxoid change is present at the deep margin over at least a 5 mm front (Blocks 13, 14 &amp;amp; 15). The tumour mass and deep loose myxoid stromal change are &amp;gt; 10 mm from all peripheral margins.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nExcision of lesion, right forearm (post radiotherapy):  Malignant spindle cell tumour consistent with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma with treatment effect\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecimenReceivedDate\n2737-09-03 00:00:00\n\n\nLastName\nUnikel\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "DATE: 19940518=>1994-05-18\nHOSPITAL: ROMA HOSPITAL\nPATIENT: Elijah\nIDNUM: 54Y420989P\nMEDICALRECORD: 5494209\nPATIENT: Collin\nDATE: 29/10/71=>2071-10-29\nDOCTOR: O Braddy\nTIME: 2737-09-03 00:00:00=>2737-09-03T00:00:00\nPATIENT: Unikel\n"}]}

RS (M-37/ MC/cy)\n\nMICROSCOPIC:   (Dr Q Kilduff)\nSections of the gallbladder, spleen and omentum show numerous serosal deposits of mucinous tumour. Within the mucin and also within fibroblastic reaction and infiltrating into adipose tissue are nests and groups of tumour cells with intermediate to focally high grade nuclear features including nuclear hyperchromasia and nuclear shape irregularities. There is multi-vacuolated cytoplasm in some cells including some signet ring cells and in some nests of tumour cells there is a somewhat goblet cell like morphology of some cell groups.\nSections of the first described segment  of small bowel show numerous serosal, subserosal and mesenteric deposits of mucinous tumour with groups on nests of cells with mucinous cytoplasm including signet ring cells. These infiltrate within the mucus pools and also within fibroblastic and fibrous stroma.\nSections of the right hemicolectomy show destruction of the appendix by mucinous tumour composed of mucinous pools with nests and groups of cells with  mucinous cytoplasm including signet ring cells. These are also seen on the serosal surfaces of the adjacent mesoappendix and mesocolon and on the serosal surface of the segment of terminal ileum. At the base of the appendix there is infiltration of poorly differentiated mucinous tumour within the submucosa and mucosa and muscularis propria of the appendix and caecum. Signet ring cells and some groups with goblet cell morphology are seen.\nTwo lymph nodes are identified and these show reactive changes.\nThe other nodules are macroscopically thought to be possible lymph nodes representing extranodal deposits of mucinous tumour within mesentery/mesocolon.\nSections of the next described longest segment of large bowel show serosal deposits of tumour similar to that previously described.\nSections of the second piece of large bowel show serosal deposits of tumour similar to that previously described.\nSections of the smallest segment of bowel consists of small bowel with full thickness involvement of the serosa, muscularis propria, submucosa and mucosa with infiltrating tumour composed of nests, groups and cords of cells with  abundant mucinous cytoplasm.\nSection of the separate fragment of fibrofatty tissue consistent with peritoneum show nodules of tumour similar to that previously described.\nImmunohistochemistry: There is positive staining for CK20 and CDX-2. CK7 is negative. Rare cells are positive for chromogranin and synaptohysin in the metastatic deposits and occasional cells are positive for there in the section from the base of the appendix. Ki-67 shows variable staining that ranges from less than 10% to at least 20% in some areas/nests of tumour.\nCOMMENT:\nThe appearances are those of poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring cells and the primary site appears to be the appendix. There are also nests of cells with a goblet cell morphology, however the majority of the tumour tissue does not show features of neuroendocrine differentiation. Nevertheless the appearances are suggestive that the tumour arose in a pre-existing goblet cell carcinoid but this has been overrun by mucinous adenocarcinoma.\nThe peritoneal disease is classified as high grade mucinous carcinoma peritonei (with signet ring cells) [PSOGI classification system].\nDIAGNOSIS:\nPERITONECTOMY:\nAPPENDICEAL MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA WITH SIGNET RING CELLS AND,\nHIGH GRADE MUCINOUS CARCINOMA PERITONEI WITH SIGNET RING CELLS - SEE TEXT AND COMMENT.\n\n22/2/2066 ht\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 69Q562005G\nMEDICALRECORD: 69656200\nHOSPITAL: CLARE HOSPITAL\nIDNUM: 69Q56200\nIDNUM: 69Q562005G\nPATIENT: LONGOBARDI, KURTIS HOLLIS\nDOCTOR: Q Kilduff\nDATE: 22/2/2066=>2066-02-22\n"}]}

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Secky):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr I Debore who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Carlo comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.  Pancreatic core biopsy (frozen section):\n-    Atypical mucinous epithelium which in this context is consistent with adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Pancreatic biopsy (frozen section):\n-    Adenocarcinoma with perineural invasion (see comment).\n\nC.  Right ovarian lesion (frozen section):\n-    Low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.
