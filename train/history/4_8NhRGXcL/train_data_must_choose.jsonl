Section of the livershow a 60mm deposit of metastatic carcinoma. The carcinoma is relatively well circumscribed with a thin fibrous pseudocapsule at the advancing edge. The tumour has a mixed papillary, alveolar and nested architecture with large areas of haemorrhage. The cells are large and polygonal with abundant clear to granular eosinophilic cytoplasm with patchy intracytoplasmic Schmorls positive melanin. The nuclei are central to eccentrically located with coarse to vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli.  There are also occasional cells with large pleomorphic nuclei and/or multiple nuclei, prominent macronucleoli, consistent with Fuhrmann and ISUP grade 4. In some areas there are vaguely nodular areas of smaller cells surrounded by areas of larger more pleomorphic cells.  Rare foci of psammomatous calcifications are seen.  Mitosis are inconspicuous (less than 1/10 hpf) and there are patchy small foci of necrosis comprising than 5% of the tumour.  There are patchy foci of intratumoural acute and subacute haemorrhage. \nIn areas the tumour abuts the liver capsule or is separated from it by intervening compressed hepatic parenchyma.  There is associated overlying capsular organising haemorrhage, however, no capsular penetration is seen.  The surgical resection margin is 5mm clear.  Thereare two foci highly suspicious for lymphovascular invasion adjacent to the subcapsular edge of the tumour (A3).  \nThe current subcapsular hepatic deposit shows similar features to the previously excised deposit on the capsular surface of the liver (90E53839) and paracaval lymph nodes metastases (90E53839) and is consistent with metastatic Xp11 translocation carcinoma (original renal primary diagnosis by Dr Y Drott and Dr Y Jelsma in nephrectomy specimen (YAE53839-31DX). \nAdjacent to the tumour there are scatted foci of granulomatous inflammation  including foci containing polarisable suture material consistent with previous surgery.  No pathogenic organisms are seen on dPAS or Fite stains. \nThe uninvolved liver displays a preserved lobular architecture. There are occasional degenerate neutrophils and lymphocytes within the portal tracts most likely due to surgery. There is no significant interface hepatitis, lobular inflammation, steatosis or fibrosis. No iron deposition or intrahepatic bile seen on Perls or Halls staining.\nB.  Sections show fibroadipose tissue containing a 20mm deposit of metastatic carcinoma with similar features to the liver tumour, consistent with metastatic Xp11 translocation renal carcinoma.

The adenocarcinoma shows extensive involvement of the omentum and strips of peritoneum,the serosal surface of the gallbladder, together with mesocolic and perirectal fatty deposits. The carcinoma is characterised by lakes of mucin lined by malignant epithelium with moderate to marked cytologic atypia, together with infiltrating malignant glands within desmoplastic stroma. \nThe tumour described in the segment of colon including the probable anastomotic site, (anastomosis not confirmed in the sections), is the likely primary site. There is an in-situ villous component with high grade dysplasia merging with invasive malignancy extending into pericolic fat. The tumour described at the proximal end of the sigmoid colon shows features favouring metastatic origin. The bulk of the tumour is within the muscularis propria and fat, but does extend to ulcerate the mucosa which is otherwise non dysplastic. \nSections of the splenic parenchyma are unremarkable. Sections of small bowel mucosa are unremarkable. Thegallbladder mucosa is largely autolyzed in the sections examined. \nDIAGNOSIS:  \nSEGMENTS OF COLON AND RECTUM, SMALLBOWEL, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, OMENTUM AND PERITONEUM -\n - WIDESPREAD METASTATIC MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED ADENOCARCINOMA OF MOST LIKELY COLONIC ORIGIN (IN SEGMENT DESCRIBED WITH ANASTOMOTIC SITE). \n- METASTATIC DEPOSITS WITHIN SIGMOID COLON AND PERIRECTAL TISSUES, PERITONEUM, OMENTUM AND SURFACE OF THE GALLBLADDER. \n8/8/64 ht\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 10R066649M\nMEDICALRECORD: 1060666.MYM\nPATIENT: Mccreery, FOSTER\nIDNUM: 10R06664\nLOCATION-OTHER: LOT 4 NEVERFAIL BAY\nCITY: BAY VIEW\nSTATE: Northern Territory\nZIP: 1851\nDATE: 24/2/1994=>1994-02-24\nTIME: 03/06/2014 at 15:00=>2014-06-03T15:00\nDEPARTMENT: Peter Mac\nHOSPITAL: NARRANDERA HOSPITAL\nDOCTOR: Miguel CHANCE PLOUFFE\nDOCTOR: IN\nDOCTOR: D.

Left lobe of liver, gallbladder.  \nMACROSCOPIC:\nA.  Specimen labelled \"Left lateral liver\" consists of a wedge of liver measuring 190 x 95 x 40mm and weighing 351g.  There are two exposed areas (presumed surgical margin) measuring 100 x 35mm and 60 x 15mm, both inked blue.  The staple margin is removed and inked black.  On sectioning there is an irregular cream mass (nodule 1) measuring 30 x 20 x 35mm that appears to abut the surgical margin.  There is a further triangular subcapsular lesion (nodule 2) measuring 30 x 20 x 40mm. Between nodule 1 and 2 there are several cream nodules 5-10mm. The liver also contains several dilated ducts, two calculi are present within these ducts, 10 and 12mm. The remaining liver parenchyma is macroscopically unremarkable.\nBlocks: 1 & 2 - (paired blocks) mass deep to surgical margin; 3 to 5  - sections from base of nodule 1 to nodule 2 ; 6 - further section of mass nodule 1; 7 & 8 - (paired blocks) representative nodule 2; 9 - further section of nodule 2; 10 - section of macroscopically uninvolved liver.\nB.  Specimen labelled \"Gallbladder\" consists of a gallbladder received unopened measuring 80 x 40 x 25mm.  The serosal surface appears congested.  Nocystic duct lymph node is identified.  One gallstone is contained within the gallbladder measuring 30 x 23 x 15mm.  The mucosa appears slightly flattened in areas but is otherwise unremarkable.  The maximum wall thickness is 3mm.\nBlocks: 1 - cystic duct; 2 - two TS gallbladder body; 3 - two LS gallbladder fundus.  \n(FJ/ta 26/7/63) \nMICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr Q Rosebure)\nA.  Sections of the liver lesion show broad area of confluent fibrosis containing variably ectatic to narrowed bile ducts and a moderate to heavy mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate. Some of the larger ducts contain small remnants of calculus debris attached to their reactive epithelial lining, while smaller ducts show periductal oedema and luminal narrowing. Some of the ducts contain acute inflammatory cells  with inflammatory cell exocytosis and patchy mild reactive change of the epithelium. A proliferation of small calibre bile ducts is present in areas. The inflammation consists of lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils,histiocytes and neutrophils. There are scattered foreign body giant cells, some of which surround cholesterol cleft like spaces, as well as, a granuloma. No pathogenic organisms are seen with PASf and truants. No significant cytologicatypia or necrosis is identified. The lesion extends to within 0.25mm of the inked margin. The immediately adjacent liver parenchyma shows large duct obstructive type changes including a bile ductular proliferation and acute inflammation within the portal tracts. The uninvolved liver shows mild mixed portal inflammation with patchy mild macrovesicular steatosis. No dPAS positive alpha-1-antitrypsin globules are seen. Special stains for iron and copper are pending. Thereis patchy early fibrosis. No convincing cirrhosis is seen. \nImmunohistochemical stains were performed and the results are as follows:\nLesion positive for: SMA (strong background staining within area of confluent fibrosis).\nLesion negative for: Desmin, CAM5.2, CD23, CD21, ALK1 and pancytokeratin (non-specific).  \nKappa and lambda stains show no evidenceof light chain restriction.\nB.  Sections of gallbladder show chronic active cholecystitis. The lamina propria contains a moderate, diffuse mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate, including numerous neutrophils. In areas, the neutrophils infiltrate the surface epithelium and there are scattered lymphoid aggregates and follicles. The muscularis propria is thickened and there is Rokitansky-Aschoff sinus formation. One pericholecystic lymph node shows reactive change (0/1). There is no evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. \nCOMMENT:\nThe left lateral liver lesion consists of a broad area of confluent fibrosis containing variably ectatic to narrowed bile ducts and a moderate to heavy mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate. There is prominent diffuse staining for SMA, and desmin, ALK-1 and cytokeratin stains are negative. The overall histologic features favour hepatolithiasis with an obstructive cholangitis, large duct obstruction within the adjacent liver and a chronic active cholecystitis. However, the differential diagnosis could also include an inflammatory pseudo-tumour; primary inflammatory bile duct disease; and although considered less likely, an infective etiology. Given the broad differential diagnosis, this case will be sent to Professor RANDOLPH HYSMITH at DAYSURGERY UNIT Pathologists, for his expert opinion, and an additional report will be issued. \nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.  Left lateral liver: Hepatolithiasis with an associated fibroinflammatory lesion, bile duct proliferation and features of large duct obstruction within the adjacent liver (see comment).\n\nB.  Gallbladder: Chronic activecholecystitis.\n\nThis case is being sent to Professor Uhrig (Douglas Hanly Moir Pathologists) and a supplementary report will be issued.\n\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT:  (26.8.63)\nProfessor Fregeau (SA Pathology Pathologists) reports:\n\"Microscopic:\nThere is a fibroinflammatory process with a ductocentric distribution.  The mixed inflammatory infiltrate includes plasma cells, eosinophils and neutrophils, as well as foreign body giant cells containing cholesterol crystals (see photograph 1) from calculous debris.There is a similar reaction on the inner surface of ulcerated larger ducts (see photograph 2). Periductal onion skinning fibrosis and oedema are also seen.  IgG4 staining is negative in the plasma cells (stain performed at STGEORGE PRIVATE).\nImportant:  I also considered the differential diagnoses you suggested, as well as IgG4 related disease.  The prominence of extraductal cholesterol debris and also focal duct dilation with residual calculous material leads me to favour your diagnosis of hepatolithiasis causing a fibroinflammatory \"pseudotumour\".  Localised or segmental PSC is considered less likely. \nA family history should betaken.  Some patients with hepatolithiasis develop stones because of low levels of MDR3 (ABCB4 mutation). A family history of the following: early cholecystitis (low phospholipid-associated cholecystitis - LPAC - syndrome),jaundice of pregnancy in females, drug induced jaundice and unexplained biliary cirrhosis can be present in patients with inherited MDR3 deficiency.  If the family history is suggestive, ursodeoxycholic acid is of benefit to prevent lithiasis. I am not aware of any Australian centres that provided MDR3 gene analysis\".  \n \n\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 62B233690X\nMEDICALRECORD: 6202336.ZAX\nPATIENT: HUYARD, NELSON\nIDNUM: 62B23369\nSTREET: Alvernaz\nCITY: LEETON\nSTATE: Queensland\nZIP: 1237\nDATE: 19/2/2001=>2001-02-19\nTIME: 24/05/2013 at 14:02=>2013-05-24T14:02\nDEPARTMENT: POW L7 CONSULTING ROOMS\nHOSPITAL: LAUNCESTON GENERAL HOSPITAL\nDOCTOR: PHILIP CHANG PHILMORE\nDOCTOR: Bement\nDEPARTMENT: 105 HAMRUN CIRCUIT\nDOCTOR: FJ\nDATE: 26/7/63=>2063-07-26\nDOCTOR: Q Rosebure\nDOCTOR: RANDOLPH HYSMITH\nDEPARTMENT: DAYSURGERY UNIT\nDOCTOR: Uhrig\nDEPARTMENT: Douglas Hanly Moir\nDATE: 26.8.63=>2063-08-26\nDOCTOR: Fregeau\nDEPARTMENT: SA Pathology\nDEPARTMENT: STGEORGE PRIVATE\nCOUNTRY: Australia\n"}]}

The tumour has a predominantly papillary growth pattern, but also shows areas of tubular growth pattern.  There are scattered psammoma bodies present.  The papillary cores in some areas have a hyalinised appearance.  In some areas, eosinophilic material is seen within the tubular structures.  Individual tumour cells have abundant clear cytoplasm, and irregular nuclei with some nuclear membrane folding, and small nucleoli.  There is little or no nuclear stratification in most areas.  Mitotic figures are extremely sparse (less than 1 per 10 high power fields).  Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumour is positive for EMA, PAX8, Ber-EP4, CK7, and HBME-1.  It shows very weak variable focal positivity for p53, and very focal positivity for Napsin A.  It is negative for WT1, cytokeratin 20, calretinin, CEA, p16, AMACR, and D-240.\nThis case has been subject to intradepartmental consultation.  The appearances raise a differential diagnosis of clear cell carcinoma versus serous carcinoma.

The tumour is comprised of bundles of spindle cells in a fibrotic and variably oedematous background, with no significant nuclear atypia or hypercellularity and scant mitoses (up to 1 / 10hpf).  A few scattered chronic inflammatory cells are seen in the lesion.  There is fibrinoid change around some of the blood vessels, with atherosis also seen in a few vessels.  A thin layer of fibrinous exudate is present on the serosal surface.\nThe ovary is separate from the mass lesion. The ovary shows corpora albicantes.\nMild active chronic inflammation and oedema are noted in the fallopian tube.\nNo evidence of malignancy or dysplasia is seen.\nHaemorrhage, necrosis, oedema and associated inflammatory cells are likely due to torsion injury of a large fibroma rather tumour necrosis.  Correlation with clinical features is recommended.\n\nB. The sections of the ovary show corpora albicantes, surface inclusion cysts and areas of stromal hyperplasia. There is no evidence of malignancy or atypia.\n\nC.  The sections show sheets of cells with areas of necrosis and some associated inflammatory cells with some fatty tissue.  The cells have monotonous, round nuclei without prominent nucleoli and moderate amounts of eosinophilic, slightly vacuolated cytoplasm.   Immunohistochemistry shows widespread expression of pan keratin (Cam 5.2) antigens. There are also many cells expressing CD68 antigen, a histiocytic marker. Calretinin antigen is expressed in a more patchy distribution compared to pan keratin antigens, probably because many of the cells are degenerate.  Inhibin antigen is not expressed. There is no convincing expression of oestrogen and progesterone receptor antigens. Ki67 is expressed in an estimated 3% of cells.\nThese features are consistent with nodular mesothelial hyperplasia with no evidence of malignancy.\n\nD. The sections show lobulated mature adipose tissue consistent with omentum. Patchy mild to moderate chronic inflammation, fibrosis and mesothelial hyperplasia are seen.  There is no evidence of malignancy or atypia.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA. Left ovary and fallopian tube: Fibroma with changes consistent with torsion injury.\nB.

Previous history of a testicular germ cell tumour approximately 13yrs ago and had retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Para-aortic tumour en block resection with infra-renal aorta.\n\nConfirmed with Dr SHAWN DEANGELES (surgical oncology fellow) that main specimen does not require formal orientation as tumour macroscopically extend to margins (AP 16/3/71).\n\n\nMACROSCOPIC:\nA.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Para-cable mass (?sarcoma)&amp;quot;, consists of a 25 x 15 x 10mm nodule with a cream and vaguely nodular cut surface. Bisected and half embedded for frozen section.  Blocks: 1 - frozen section; 2 - remaining tissue. AE.\nB.  Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Peri-aortic tumour&amp;quot;, consists of a segment of aorta 43mm long to a diameter of 17mm (lumen 10mm) with surrounding adherent soft tissue, 50 x 42 x 35mm. Tissue is sampled fresh for biobanking. No anatomical landmarks are present for definite orientation (confirmed with surgical team orientation not required). The tissue is arbitrarily inked blue and black. The cut surface shows heterogeneous soft tissue surrounding a fibrotic aortic wall with focal fatty streaks. Whilst heterogeneous soft tissue may represent tumour, no measurable discrete lesion is identified. Numerous lymph nodes measuring up to 7mm in greatest dimension are distributed throughout the soft tissue. No tumour thrombus or luminal thrombus formation is seen.

If previous testicular tumour is a germ cell tumour may represent treatment effect with mature teratoma. Discussed with the surgical reg. Previous orchidectomy performed in New Zealand 15yrs ago.\nResult phoned to Surgical registrar by Dr J Stencel and Dr J Sacks at 12:15 on 12/1/21.\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr J Ernspiker):\nA. Paraffin embedded sections show fibrocollagenous tissue with patchy chronic inflammation and fat necrosis containing scattered islands of mature cartilage. A simple mucin lined ductule is also seen. In the clinical context of previous testicular tumour this is favoured to represent a focus of residual mature teratoma with treatment effect/fibrosis. There is no evidence of malignant germ cell tumour or sarcoma.\n\nB. Sections show aorta with surrounding peri-aortic tissue. There is extensive involvement of the fibrotic periaortic soft tissue by an infiltrative malignant sarcomatoid tumour. In the blocks submitted, the overall estimated maximum tumour dimension is 22mm (however, tumour is present at the margin and total tumour extent cannot be determined). The tumour is composed of malignant spindled to epithelioid cells arranged in dense cellular infiltrative sheets which dissect through periaortic fibrocollagen. In areas, the tumour cells appear to form malignant, anastomosing vascular channels lined by malignant hobnailed endothelial cells. The vasoformative tumour abuts and infiltrates into the adventitia and outer media of the aorta. Mitoses are readily identified and there are scattered foci of tumour necrosis. The tumour shows extensive crush type artefact and multifocal perineural involvement. The tumour extends broadly to the edges of the excision.\n\nFive lymph nodes are identified, one of which shows direct infiltration by tumour (1/5).\n\nImmunohistochemistry demonstrates positivity for vascular markers ERG, CD31 and CD34, as well as, BCL-2 (patchy), synaptophysin (weak),  Additional stains for inhibin, myogenin, LCA, WT1 (cytoplasm staining only), PLAP, AFP, desmin, tdt, pancytokeratin, CD56, SMA, TLE-1, MIC-2, CAM5.2, SOX-10 and OCT-34 are negative. INI-1 shows preserved (normal) nuclear staining.\n\nIn addition, within the surrounding fibrocollagenous and adipose tissue, there are occasional foci of cartilage on a background of broad nodules and sheets of dense organised fibrosis with  superimposed dystrophic calcification, fat necrosis and inflammation. Several entrapped medium to large nerves and ganglia are also seen. These background changes are suggestive of focal residual mature teratoma on a background of previous treatment related effect.\n\nC. Section show fibrocollagenous and adipose tissue showing fibrosis with superimposed patchy chronic inflammation and fat necrosis. No cartilage is seen. There is no evidence of malignancy.\n\nD. Sections show fibrocollagenous and adipose tissue showing fibrosis with superimposed patchy chronic inflammation and fat necrosis. A 1.1mm focus of adrenal cortical parenchyma, as well as, seven reactive appearing lymph nodes (0/7). No cartilage is seen. There is no evidence of malignancy.\n\nE. Section show fibrocollagenous and adipose tissue showing fibrosis with superimposed patchy chronic inflammation and fat necrosis. A single reactive lymph node is seen. No cartilage is identified. There is no evidence of malignancy.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe presence of islands of residual mature cartilage associated with organising fibrosis, inflammation, dystrophic calcification and fat necrosis in specimens A and B (para caval and peri aortic masses), is highly suggestive of residual mature teratoma on a background of treatment associated change. No evidence of malignant germ cell elements are seen.\n\nAs reported in the previous biopsy by Professor Jaussen, there is an associated peri-aortic high grade malignant sarcoma, which may represent: (a) malignant transformation arising within the previously treated para-aortic tumour; (b) or, a de novo sarcoma. In these specimens, the high grade sarcoma demonstrates malignant vasoformative morphology, as well as, strong diffuse staining with endothelial markers, consistent with a high grade angiosarcoma.\nSarcoma is present at margins.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA. Para-caval mass: Favour residual mature teratoma with treatment effects. No evidence of malignant germ cell tumour, sarcoma or malignancy.\n\nB. Peri-aortic tumour:\n- Malignant vasoformative tumour, consistent with high grade angiosarcoma, present at margins.\n- One of five lymph nodes shows direct invasion by angiosarcoma.\n- Background nodular organised fibrosis and dystrophic calcification ?treatment related change.\n\nC. Left retrocaval: Fibrosis and patchy mild non-specific chronic inflammation.\n\nD. Right superior renal mass: 1.1mm focus of adrenal cortex on a background of multiple ganglia, fibrosis and inflammation. Seven reactive lymph nodes are present.\n\nE. Anterior aortic tissue at renal vessels: Fibrosis and patchy mild non-specific chronic inflammation (0/1).\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 31W046763B\nMEDICALRECORD: 31804676\nHOSPITAL: YARRA RANGES HEALTH\nDATE: Previous=>2058-03-16\nDURATION: 13yrs=>P13Y\nDOCTOR: SHAWN DEANGELES\nDATE: 16/3/71=>2071-03-16\nDATE: 16/3/71=>2071-03-16\nDATE: Previous=>2056-03-16\nDURATION: 15yrs=>P15Y\nDOCTOR: J Stencel\nDOCTOR: J Sacks\nTIME: 12:15 on 12/1/21=>2021-01-12T12:15\nDOCTOR: J Ernspiker\nDOCTOR: Jaussen\n"}]}

Sections show a serous carcinoma involving serosa and parametrium of uterus, both ovaries and fallopian tubes.  The tumourshows predominately psammomatous calcification (more than 95%).  Focally, neoplastic serous epithelium is present (less than 5%) with mild cytological atypia and papillary architecture.  Tumour cells with high grade nuclei are also focally seen.  Within the tumour, there is extensive fibrosis and numerous foamy macrophages.  In the right clinical setting the appearances are in keeping with those of previous neoadjuvant therapy.  The uterus shows a large intramural leiomyoma.  There is a large endometrial polyp with cystically dilated gland.  The rest of endometrium is atrophic.  The cervix is unremarkable.  For both ovaries, the tumour mainly involves the surface and outer halves of cortex.  The lumen of right fallopian tube is completely filled by tumour.  In the specimen A, the tumour appears to be centred on right fallopian tube and right ovary.\nB.

Sections show omental tissue involved by a serous carcinoma with extensive psammomatous calcification (more than 95%).  The appearances are identical those described in the specimen A.\nComment:\nThe tumour shows extensive psammomatous calcification (more than 95%).  It is difficult to properly grade the tumour due to minimal amount of neoplastic epithelium (less than 5%).  The presence of extensive fibrosis and numerous macrophages is suggestive of previous neoadjuvant therapy.  If the patient had received neoadjuvant therapy, please refer to previous biopsy for tumour grading.  The most likely primary site is peritoneum.  The right fallopian tube is another possibility.

The attached fallopian tube is 58mm in length x 5mm in diameter and appears unremarkable with the exception of a 7mm parafimbrial cyst.  A 3 x 3mm yellow nodule is noted on the serosal surface of the soft tissue between the ovary and fallopian tube.  The ovary is sectioned transversely into 9 slices and shows a relatively well circumscribed 19 x 11 x approximately 20mm pale yellow lesion underlying the puckered serosal region (slices 4 to 8).

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Z Erschen):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr Z Montecillo who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Stephen comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

Multiple small nodules attached to SB mesentery.  Previous sarcoma left leg (excised July 2062)\nMACROSCOPIC:\nSpecimen labelled \"Intra-abdominal sarcoma (received fresh)\" consists of a large fibrofatty myxoid lobular mass with adherent omentum weighing 2.63kg and measuring 210 x 200 x 100mm.  The specimen is divided for cytogenetics and 2 imprints done (sent to THE FORENSIC HOSPITAL's Hospital).  There are two areas adherent omentum, the larger area measures 180 x 50 x 30mm.  The smaller area measures 80 x 70 x 25mm.  Both areas of omentum are nodular and have discreet round encapsulated nodules of tumour within them.  The tumour is well circumscribed and partly encapsulated.  On sectioning the tumour shows a smoothglistening myxoid surface with areas of haemorrhage and necrosis.  On one surface of the tumour next to the largest area of adherent omentum there is a stapled margin measuring 55mm (inked blue)? muscle.  Included with the specimen are several well circumscribed nodules of tumour measuring from 5mm to 55mm in maximum dimension. \nBlocks:  1 to 21 representative tumour (blocks 8 and 9 blue surgical margins); 22 and 23 -representative of adherent omentum and nodules (block 22 larger omentum block 23 smaller omentum); 24 to 33- representative of smaller nodules. \n(QV/vo 26.7.63)\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Casado):\nSections show a myxoid liposarcoma (grade 1).  The tumour shows prominent myxoid stroma with a branching, plexiform (chicken-wire) capillary vasculature.  Scattered univacuolated (signet ring) lipoblasts are present.  No definite necrosis is seen and mitotic activityis rare.  Round cell areas are focally present and are less than 5% of total area sampled.  Therefore the tumour scores grade 1.  A piece of liver tissue is seen adherent to the tumour (block 11).  The tumour is incompletely excised.

Adjacent nests and cords of cells and single cells with eosinophilic to vacuolated cytoplasm are seen and with more nuclear pleomorphism including vesicular chromatin and nucleoli.  There is a desmoplastic stromal reaction.\n\nSections of the tumour mass from the en block resection of stomach, colon, pancreas, spleen and presumed portion of diaphragm, demonstrate moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with similar appearances to those seen in the omental tumour mass.  The tumour largely obliterates the colon in the sections examined and there is direct infiltration within the adjacent omentum into the stomach with infiltration through all layers of the muscularis into the submucosa and mucosa.  There is also direct invasion into the pancreas and also into the splenic parenchyma and adjacent perihilar adipose tissue.  There is direct infiltration into adherent skeletal muscle that likely represents a portion of diaphragm.\n\nTwelve transverse mesocolic lymph nodes are identified and in two of these there is metastatic carcinoma.  Splenic perihilar lymph nodes are identified and show reactive changes only.\n\nA tumour deposit is seen in lesser curve adipose tissue (lesser omentum).\n\nCarcinoma is approximatrely 2mm clear of the diathermied margin of the skeletal muscle / diaphragm.\n\nSections of the separate segment of rectum show a mesorectal deposit of moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma similar to that previously described. The carcinoma is present at the inked mesorectal margin.  In addition, there is  a tubulovillous adenoma of the rectosigmoid colon.  Three perirectal lymph nodes show reactive changes.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:  CK7 is negative. CK20 and CDX-2 are positive. MSI immunohistochemistry pending (Block 10).\n\nComment:  There is moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with morphological appearances consistent with colorectal origin.  The main tumour mass involves the en block  resection including the segment of transverse colon with direct involvement of the adjacent mesentery / omentum and with direct invasion of the stomach, spleen, pancreas and diaphragm.

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Bodamer):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr M Arostegui who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Vern comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

The tumour nodule is identified within specimen A and is composed of a diffuse proliferation of mild to moderately atypical astrocytic cells within a fibrillary background. Some of the cells show round nuclei within possiblevacuoles, imparting an 'oligodendroglial-like' appearance in some areas. The GFAP stain shows variable expression but some cells with round nuclei appear negative.\nOccasional mitoses are identified but there is no evidence of necrosis or vascular proliferation.\nThe Ki67 index is low and is approximately 1 - 2%.\nThe IDH1 stain is negative.

The previous pathology was reviewed (14B35141). In the previous biopsy, the reporting pathologist also noted that morphologically the tumour was difficult to classify and in his opinion the features favoured a diagnosis of oligodendroglioma. There was no evidence of 1p/19q co-deletion in previous testing. \nI have reviewed this case with Drs E Lewan and E Vaquero and the consensus opinion is that the current biopsy is consistent with a recurrent low grade glioma and the features favour a diagnosis of astrocytoma, WHO grade 2. \ncase was discussed with Dr E Pacifico and was presented at the Neurosurgical MDT meeting 18/8/2064. \nDIAGNOSIS:\nA. and B.

Hypercholesterolemia. Depression.  Hypothyroidism.  Omentalnodule.  \nMACROSCOPIC:\nA.  Specimen labelled \"Omental nodule\", consists of a nodular solid tumour measuring 50 x 30 x 16mm.  Two representative sections for FS. \nBlock 1 &2 - FS; 3 & 4- rest of FS. \nFROZEN SECTION:  Poorly differentiated large cell malignancy.  \nResult to Dr C Vant by Dr C Kugel at 9:35am on 28.5.12. \nB.  Specimen labelled \"Uterus, tubes, ovaries and sigmoid\", consists of a uterus with a large tumour mass attachedand a segment of sigmoid colon attached.  The specimen  measures in 230 x 160 x 100mm.  The uterus measures 100 x 70 x 50mm.  The cervix measures 40 x 30 x 30mm.  The large and necrotic mass is located on the right and posterior aspects of the uterus and also extends inferior to the cervix.  The posterior surface of the mass is necrotic and very irregular and ragged but in the right adnexal region the mass mostly hasa smooth outer surface.  The segment of colon is attached to the left aspect of the uterus by multiple adhesions and the necrotic mass. \nThe endometrium measures 1mm in maximum thickness. The myometrium measures 30mm in maximum thickness and is infiltrated by the tumour mass from the posterior aspect.  The right fallopian tube and ovary are not identified.  The left fallopian tube measures 55mm in length and 5mm in maximum diameter and appears macroscopically unremarkable.  The left ovary measures 30 x 20 x 20mm and is adherent to the tumour mass.  On sectioning the cut surface appears totally replaced by tumour.  The cut surface of the tumour mass is necrotic, haemorrhagic and friable. \n Blocks 1-4 - 1full LS anterior body and cervix; 5-11 - 1 full LS posterior body and cervix with tumour; 12-16 - 5 representative sections from the right adnexal tumour; 17 - 1TS from the right cornu; 18 - 2LS left Fimbria.; 19 - TS Fallopian tube \n20 - 1TS left ovary; 21 - proximal margin of colon; 22 - distal margin of colon; 23-25 - colon with tumour; 26 - pericolic fat with tumorous deposit; 27 - tumour for tumour bank (taken from the right ovary); 28, 29 - further cervix.\nC.  Specimen labelled \"Omental cake\", consists ofa piece of omentum with multiple tumour deposits.  It measures 350 x 130 x 50mm. The largest tumour deposit measures 110 x 80 x 50mm.  On sectioning of the tumour deposits are necrotic with areas of haemorrhage.  Representative sections in 3 blocks. \nD.  Specimen labelled \"Ileum\", consists of a segment of ileum measuring 55mm in length and up to 30mm in maximum diameter.  The serosal surface has a ragged area measuring 20 x 15mm. The mucosal surface is unremarkable.  Proximal and distal section margins are inked blue and black.  Blocks 1-4 - 4LS of the specimen including distal and proximal margin with areas of ragged serosal surface.  \n(PG/ec 1.7.62) \nMICROSCOPIC: (Reported by Dr C Eggert)\nA.  Sections show a deposit of poorly differentiated, high grade serous carcinoma.  This consists mainly of sheets of cells with large, pleomorphic nuclei and a variable amount of amphophilic cytoplasm.  There is some gland formation focally.  \nB.  Sections of the mass show a poorly differentiated (grade 3) serous carcinoma. Some of it consists of sheets of cells but there are patchy areas showing formation of slit-like glands.  There is patchy, prominent tumour necrosis.  Tumour is confirmed to invade the myometrium, and also invades the upper posterior endocervix, from the posterior aspect of the uterus and cervix.  There is very widespread lymphovascular invasion in the myometrium and in the cervix.  Sections of the cervix are otherwise unremarkable, apart from the tumour invasion of deep stroma of the upper posterior endocervix, and the extensive lymphovascular invasion.  Sections of the endometrium show that this is thin and inactive.    \nSections of the right adnexal mass show similar tumour.  No definite ovarian tissue, and no fallopian tube, are identified in association with the right adnexal tumour in the sections examined.  Sectionsof the left fallopian tube are unremarkable.  Sections of the left ovary show tumour on the seroeal surface but with minimal involvement of the ovary itself.  \nSections of the sigmoid colon show tumour on the serosal aspect and invading through the wall, focally into submucosa, but the mucosa appears intact.  Tumour is identified in seven out of seven (7/7) lymph nodes which were identified in the attached mesentery, and there is also prominent lymphovascular invasion in the mesentery. The proximal and distal excision margins of the colon are free of tumour.  \nC.  Sections of the omentum show extensive involvement by poorly differentiated serous carcinoma.  There is prominent tumour necrosis. \nD.  Sections show small intestinal wall. There is serosal involvement by serous carcinoma.  The mucosa, submucosa and muscle layers are not involved. The proximal and distal resection margins of the bowel segment are free of tumour.

AE.  Please refer to attached diagrams.   \n(AF/cc  13/6/63) \n \nMICROSCOPIC(Reported by Dr J Kopischke): \nThe specimen has been entirely embedded and examined.  Sections show a 1.4mm focus of classic infiltrating lobular carcinoma (block 15), as well as at least six foci of consistent with microinvasive lobular carcinoma (measuring up to 1mm in maximum dimension)(blocks 8, 12 ,16 & 23) arising within an extensive 70mm field of intermediate and high grade ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS), the later including both classic and pleomorphic subtypes.  The separate invasive carcinomas are distributed across 25mm.  The invasive carcinomas are too small for formal grading but appear intermediate grade (tubule =3, nuclei =2, mitoses =0).  No definite lymphovascular invasionis seen.  A couple of the microinvasive foci are only detected in deeper levels examined with a keratin immunostain (block 12).  No carcinoma cells are present in the sections examined (twice) with ER (1.4mm lesion), however, similar appearing microinvasive carcinoma is strongly positive.\nTwo of the three tumours detected grossly are foci of mass forming high grade DCIS/pleomorphic LCIS.  Within some of the affected lobules there is colocalisation of high grade DCIS and pleomorphic lobular carcinoma within the same duct space with confirmatory positive and negative staining with E cadherin respectively (block 15). These two mass forming areas are located towardsthe inferior and central parts of the specimen.  The third more superiorly placed nodule is in fact an intramammary lymph node (blocks 47 & 55) which shows no evidence of metastatic tumour in multiple levels examined or with a keratin immunostain.   \nThe pleomorphic LCIS shows some apocrine features, foci of comedonecrosis and microcalcifications.  The high grade DCIS is also associated with calcifications to a lesser extent.  Although the calcification is mainly associated with mass forming areas of in situ carcinoma all of the intervening slices also show dispersed foci of intermediate to high grade DCIS, often clinging type, which in most instances is unassociated with calcification.  There is also calcification associated with benign intraductal proliferations, mainly columnar cell alteration both with and without hyperplasia.  Some of the columnar cell foci showing superimposed architectural and cytological atypia amounting to atypical ductal hyperplasia.  Foci of flat epithelial atypia are also seen.\nA synoptic report for breast carcinoma follows (please note that ductal carcinoma in situ and pleomorphic lobular carcinoma in situ components are grouped together in the margin summary as are the multiple invasive carcinomas).   \n  \nInvasive carcinoma:\nSite: Left breast.\nType: Infiltrating lobular (classic type).  \nInvasive tumour size: 1.4mm (block 15) plus multiple separate foci of microinvasion (up to 1mm) (blocks 8, 12 &16)\nGrade (Modified Bloom & Richardson): probably 2 (for 1.4mm focus)\nTubules: 3     Nuclei: 2     Mitoses: 0 (insufficient fields)     \nLymphovascular invasion:  Not seen\n\t    \nDCIS or Pleomorphic LCIS:  \nDCIS:  present\nPleomorphic LCIS: present\nMaximum extent of DCIS: Approximately 70mm (all 15 slices)\nNuclear grade:  Intermediate to high\nArchitecture (DCIS): Cribriform, micropapillary and clinging\nNecrosis:  present\nCalcification: present (mainly in pleomorphic lobular component)\nExcision Margins:  \nInvasive component: (microinvasive and invasive foci)\nMedial - 1.4mm with intervening classic LCIS (block 8).  \nLateral (towards deep) - 2.2mm with intervening classic LCIS extending to the margin (block 15).  \nDeep towards lateral - 8mm (block 23)\nSuperficial, inferior, superior - well clear (>10mm)\nIn-situ component - (DCIS or pleomorphic LCIS) \nInferior -0.1mm (no intervening normal ducts) (block 1) \nIn situ component (cont.)\nLateral - 1.1mm (no intervening normal ducts) (block 11)\nMedial - 3.5mm (with intervening normal ducts) (block 16)\nSuperior - 5.2mm (with intervening normal ducts) (block 70)\nDeep - 3mm (with intervening normal ducts) (block 12)\nSuperficial - well clear (>10mm).\nReceptors (Blocks 15 & 16): \nER 1.4mm focus cut out (block 15); 95% strongly positive in small separate focus (block 16)\nPR:   positive (block 15)\n\t95% of nuclei stained\n\tpredominant intensity of staining: strong\nHER2 (Novocastra 10A7): 1+ (negative); no residual tumour tissue for CISH (block 15).

The specimen includes unremarkable appendix is 58mm in length and up to 7mm in diameter.  Centred on the anterior wall of the caecum but also involving its posterior wall and the ileocecal valve is a fungating exophytic tumour 84 x 75 x 24mm.   The tumour has pale solid and mucinous cut surfaces.  The tumour is 65mm from proximal ileal and 70mm from distal margins and does not involve the base of the appendix.  The posterior surface of the caecum appears to be peritonealised.  On sectioning the tumour appears to efface the plane of the muscularis propria but does not appear to involve the mesocolic fat.   No other polyps are identified.  Several lymph nodes are identified.

RS (M-25/ZW/cy)\nMICROSCOPIC:  (Dr P Serratore)\nSections of the gallbladder show chronic cholecystitis and cholesterolosis. In addition, there are deposits of extracellular mucin on the serosal surface, with a mesothelial reaction, but no epithelium is identified within this mucin. The cystic duct lymph node shows no involvement. \nSections of spleen show deposits of extracellular mucin on the serosal surface. No epithelium is identified within this mucin. The splenic parenchymal red and white pulp is unremarkable. Sections of colon at the site of the anastomosis show scar tissue and deposits of extracellular mucin containing strips and clumps of atypical mucinous epithelium, situated within the serosa. The atypical mucinous epithelium shows intermediate to high grade nuclear features. A focal desmoplastic reaction is seen to some of these epithelial deposits, consistent with at least focal invasion of the serosa at the site of anastomosis. Also, sections of the colon show extensive deposits of extracellular mucin containing atypical mucinous epithelium, involving the serosa and mesentery, including the surface of the serosa and mesocolon. Because ofthe presence of at least focal desmoplastic reaction consistent with invasion, these deposits are in keeping with moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma. No signet ring cell component is seen.\nSections of the small intestine show a deposit of mucinous adenocarcinoma invading the serosa and involving the serosal surface. Possible focal lymphovascular invasion is seen, and immunohistochemical stains to clarify this are in progress, with a supplementary report to follow. \nThe representative section of omentum shows deposit of extracellular mucin on the  mesothelial surface, and two of these deposits contain glands of atypical mucinous epithelium, consistent with involvement by mucinous adenocarcinoma. \nSections of peritoneum show multiple deposits of extracellular mucin and mucinous adenocarcinoma. \nThe single colonic lymph node identified shows no involvement. \nDIAGNOSIS:  \nPERITONEAL DISEASE, SPLEEN, GALLBLADDER, RIGHT COLON, OMENTUM:\n- MULTIPLE DEPOSITS OF MODERATELY DIFFERENTIATED MUCINOUS ADENOCARCINOMA INVOLVING THE SEROSA AND SEROSAL SURFACE OF THE COLON, SMALL INTESTINE, OMENTUM AND PERITONEUM. \n - DEPOSITS OF EXTRACELLULAR MUCIN WITHOUT AN EPITHELIAL COMPONENT, ON THE SEROSAL SURFACE OF GALLBLADDER AND SPLEEN. \n - THE CYSTIC DUCT LYMPH NODE, AND A SINGLE COLONIC LYMPH NODE, SHOW NO INVOLVEMENT. \n8/4/64 ht\nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT:\nImmunohistochemical stains show no evidence of lymphovascular invasion.

Sections of the rectosigmoid colon show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma which invades through the full thickness of the muscularis propria and deeply into pericolorectal tissue.  Tumour invades to within 0.5mm of the black inked radial excision margin (block A4).  Although the tumour was thought to involve the serosal surface macroscopically, on microscopic examination it extends to within 1mm of the serosal surface but no definite involvement of the serosal surface could be seen microscopically.  Two of fourteen lymph nodes are involved by metastatic adenocarcinoma.  In addition, there is extensive perineural involvement within the pericolic tissue.\n\nTumour type:  Adenocarcinoma\n\nHistologic grade:  Low grade (moderately differentiated)\n\nDepth of invasion:  T3:  Tumour invades through the muscularis propria into pericolorectal tissues, but could not be definitely identified on the surface of the visceral peritoneum microscopically.\n\nPeritoneal surface involvement: Negative ( Thought to be present macroscopically, but this could not be confirmed microscopically).\n\nTumour infiltrating lymphocytes: Low denisity (less than 5 per high power field)\n\nExcision Margins:\nProximal:  Clear (110mm macroscopic measurement)\nDistal:  Clear (45mm macroscopic measurement)\nRadial:  Tumour is located 0.5mm from the black inked radial excision margin (block A4) and is thus regarded as involved.\n\nLymph nodes:\nNumber positive:  2\nTotal number:  14\nApical node:  Negative\n\nIntramural vein invasion:  Not identified\n\nExtramural vein invasion:  Focally suspicious\n\nSmall vessel (lymphatic) invasion:  Focally suspicious\n\nPerineural invasion:  Present and extensive\n\nDistant metastases: Present ( See specimens B (right lobe liver, D and E)\n\nOther findings:\nPolyps: no\nPolyp adjacent to carcinoma: no\n\nMismatch repair enzymes, Immunostains:  to follow\n\nMicrosatellite instability (MSI):  not tested\n\nSynthesis/stage (AJCC/UICC TNM 7):\n\nTNM stage:  pT3, pN1b, M1a\n\nStage grouping:  IVA\n\n\nB.  Sections of liver confirm involvement by multiple nodules of metastatic adenocarcinoma with extensive necrosis, and a similar appearance to that in specimen A.  Metastatic adenocarcinoma involves the inked excision margin in at least two places over fronts of 4mm, 6mm and 5mm respectively.  Subcapsular nodules of metastatic adenocarcinoma are also noted, but no breach of the capsule is identified microscopically.  A section of the non-involved liver appears unremarkable.\n\nC.  Sections of the gallbladder show features of chronic cholecystitis, with prominent Rokitansky-Aschoff sinuses.  There is no evidence of malignancy  in the tissue examined.\nD.  Sections of liver confirm a nodule of metastatic adenocarcinoma with a similar appearance to that in specimen B, which involves the inked excision margin over a front of approximately 5mm (distance of involvement is difficult to assess due to tumour fragmentation at this margin).  The non-involved liver parenchyma appears unremarkable.  Sections of the non-involved liver show moderate macrovesicular steatosis.\nE.  Sections of liver show a subcapsular deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with a similar appearance to that in specimens B and D.

A lobectomy of liver weighing 1233g and measures 175x160x80mm. The capsule is roughened with areas of ?adhesion. There is a tan solid area measuring 75x70mm noted on the capsule. Underlying this area is a tumour with a tan glistening cut surface. Tumour dimensions are 75x70x43mm. There is a second brown/light brown nodule measuring 5mm in maximum dimension. This is away from tumour. The main tumour abuts the capsule and appears to involve it and is less than 1mm from the nearest resection margin.\n\n(1&amp;amp;2 5mm nodule; 3-7 sections of tumour [3 shows nearest resection margin; 5 shows relationship to normal liver parenchyma; 6&amp;amp;7 shows relation to capsule]; 8 shows area of capsular roughening ?area of adhesion; 9 shows normal liver parenchyma away from the lesion).

Serosa is smooth, the wall is up to 3mm thick. The mucosa is granular green with strip of cholesterolosis. No stones found within the lumen.\n\n(1 cystic duct and neck of gallbladder; 2 body and fundus).\n\nSpleen weighs 254g and measures 125x105x45mm. The capsule is roughened mildly with ?tumour deposits. There are two cysts noted measuring  5-7mm. On sectioning the splenic parenchyma is red to brown in appearance. No discrete lesions identified.\n\n(3 cystic areas noted on the capsule; 4 area of roughening ?tumour; 5 section through normal splenic parenchyma).\n\nOmentum - A piece of fatty tissue consistent with omentum measuring 480x220x20mm. No firm areas or nodules identified.\n\n(6&amp;amp;7 RS of omentum).\n\nSeparate pieces of tissue consistent with omentum measuring altogether 140x120x5mm. On one surface there are papillary like suggestions covering an area measuring  75x45mm.\n\n(8&amp;amp;9 peritoneum including area with papillary projection).\n\nUterus, cervix, bilateral tubes and ovaries. Uterus with attached cervix with 162g and measuring 105mm superior to inferior, 45mm intracornual distance, 17mm anterior endometrium; 30mm posterior endometrium, the endometrium is less than 1mm thick. Within the uterine cavity is an intrauterine device. The ectocervix is 45x35mm with a slit like os 14mm. It is cream coloured and unremarkable. The serosal surface shows bulging posteriorly and cystic like areas. On sectioning includes the posterior areas that appears a bit bulged. The myometrium shows an ill defined firm/scarred area measuring up to 35mm in maximum dimension. The rest of the myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.

There is a large parafimbrial cyst measuring up to 20mm in maximum dimension. It is filled with clear serous fluid. The inner wall lining is otherwise smooth. The right ovary is 45x20x10mm and is cystic in nature. On sectioning the cyst are filled with straw coloured fluid. The inner lining are smooth.\n\n(19 parafimbrial cyst; 20 right fallopian tube; 21 right ovary).\n\nThe left fallopian tube and ovary weigh 15g. Fallopian tube is 70mm in length by 7mm in maximum diameter. There is a pedunculated parafimbrial cyst measuring 20mm in maximum dimension. It is filled with clear serous fluid and has a small thinner lining. The left ovary measures 30x20x10mm. The serosal surface shows a tan nodular area measuring up to 5mm in maximum dimension. On sectioning the cut surface reveals a cyst filled with clear fluid and a smooth inner lining. It measures up to 6mm in maximum dimension.\n\n(22 left fallopian tube includes parafimbrial cyst; 23 left ovary). RS (M-23/MC/ht).\n\nMICROSCOPIC:     (Dr. J Congleton)\nA.  Sections of liver show a nodule of moderately differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma.  The tumour shows glandular and cribriform architecture and extensive tumour necrosis.  Focal lymphovascular and possible vascular invasion is noted adjacent to the main nodule.  Tumour is 3mm from the inked resection margin.  Focal invasion into the overlying liver capsule is present.  There is also focal involvement of the capsular surface.  The liver away from the tumour nodule appears unremarkable. Immunohistochemical stains show that the tumour is positive for CDX2, and negative for CK7, CK20, Estrogen receptor and Progesterone receptor.\n\nIn addition, there is a 5mm separate nodule composed of hepatocytes with a relatively normal parenchymal architecture.  Within this nodule there are occasional small bile ducts, together with ductal metaplasia.  The liver plates within this nodule are up to 2 hepatocytes in width, there is no significant nuclear atypia and no increase in mitotic activity.  The overall features are suggestive of a small focus of focal nodular hyperplasia.\n\nThe macroscopically identified area of capsular roughening shows some surface inflammatory granulation tissue and fibrosis.  No viable tumour is seen in this area.  The underlying liver parenchyma shows an irregular area of fibrosis containing epitheloid granulomas, some of which shows small foci of central necrosis.  Special stains for bacteria, fungal elements and acid fast bacilli are negative within these granulomas.  No viable tumour is detected within this granulomatous inflammation.\n\nB.  Sections of gallbladder show features of mild chronic cholecystitis. There is no evidence of malignancy in the sections of gallbladder.\n\nSections of the spleen show several small subcapsular benign mesothelial cysts. The splenic parenchyma appears unremarkable.  There is no evidence of malignancy in the representative tissue examined.\n\nSections of omentum show no evidence of malignancy. Two small omental lymph nodes are unremarkable.\n\nThe separate piece of tissue consistent with omentum shows surface papillary mesothelial hyperplasia.  There are no features to suggest mesothelial malignancy in this area.\n\nSections of uterus show a large deposit of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma within the posterior myometrium, predominantly within the outer myometrium.  This tumour extends 22mm trough a 33mm uterine wall, involving the outer half and part of the inner half of the myomehtrium. There is no obvious connection with the endometrium, which shows exogenous hormone effect with pseudodecidualised stroma and small atrophic glands.  No endometrial hyperplasia is identified.  The deposit of adenocarcinoma involves the serosal surface of the uterus.  Focal lymphovascular invasion is noted adjacent to this tumour.\n\nImmunohistochemical stain for CDX2 is strongly positive in this tumour, while Cytokeratin 7 shows focal positivity only. Cytokeratin 20, oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor are negative in this tumour deposit.The morphology and staining characteristics are similar to the tumour deposit in specimen A. The positivity for CDX2 in both tumours is supportive of a gastrointestinal primary site, although clinical correlation is recommended.\n\nElsewhere, the uterus shows adenomyosis. The cervix shows microglandular hyperplasia and numerous Nabothian follicles.  A mesothelial cyst is noted on the serosal surface of the uterus.\n\nSections of the right fallopian tube show a benign fimbrial cyst.  The fallopian tube is otherwise unremarkable.  The right ovary contains a luteinised follicular cyst, but shows no evidence of tumour.\n\nSections of the left fallopian tube and left ovary are unremarkable.\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

Sections of the right paravaginal mass confirm a leiomyosarcoma. The tumour has a heterogenous appearance and in areas shows features similar to that of the recent core biopsy (09N36082) with atypical spindled cells with myoid features arranged in poorly formed fascicles. Elsewhere, the tumour appears highly cellular and is composed of sheets of malignant epithelioid cells with vesicular chromatin, prominent nucleoli and small to moderate amounts of cytoplasm. Scattered highly atypical pleomorphic cells are seen. Mitoses are seen, up to 15 per 10 hpf, and include numerous atypical mitoses. Broad areas of coagulative (tumour) necrosis are seen, and involve up to 25% of the sampled tumour. Tumour is present within the lumen and wall of medium to large vessels at the periphery of the specimen. Whilst the tumour appears largely circumscribed, with an incomplete cuff of fibroadipose tissue, focally tumour extends along the periphery of the specimen and abuts the inked/diathermied surgical margin.\nRepresentative slides seen with Dr B Dutch.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

The sigmoid colon is 140mm long and 50mm in diameter and the rectum measures 95mm long with a diameter of 40mm.  There is perirectal fat to a thickness of up to 35mm.  The ectocervix measures 27 x 15mm and has a smooth surface.  The uterus measures 90 x 60 x 50 mm.  The vaginal vault surgical margin is inked red, the rectal radial margin is inked black and the uterus anteriorly is inked blue.  Adherent to the rectosigmoid region is a flap of peritoneum measuring 80 x 65 x 7mm with a possible tumour deposit 30mm diameter.\nThere is a large collapsed cystic tumour mass in the left adnexa and extending between the colon/rectum and uterus.  It is adherent to the anterior surface of the sigmoid colon and rectum, and to the posterior uterus, cervix and vaginal cuff.  The left ovary and tube are not separately identified and are presumably involved in the mass.  The mass has a relatively smooth outer surface and measures 165 x 140 x 35mm.  It has a nodular surface with multiple tumour deposits up to 25mm in size.  The cut surface shows a unilocular cyst with a wall thickness between 3 and 25mm.  There are a few thin walled mucoid cysts on the bowel serosa, up to 75mm diameter, adjacent to the mass.\nThe right ovary measures 25 x 15 x 7mm and the right fallopian tube measures 60mm in length with a diameter of 7mm.  The right tube and ovary are unremarkable.\nWithin the soft tissue surrounding the rectum there is a second tumour mass measuring 45 x 40 x 30mm; it has a smooth surface and appears to involve the rectal wall but does not involve the mucosa.  Within the sigmoid mesentery and perirectal fat there are multiple other small tumour deposits.  Within the wall of the sigmoid colon, 70mm from the proximal margin, there is a further tumour deposit measuring 50 x 40 x 45mm; it does not involve the mucosa.\nThe main cystic mass is firmly adherent to the posterior uterus and may also invade the outer posterior myometrium.

Sections of the large cystic mass show poorly differentiated high grade serous carcinoma.  The cyst wall is thick and fibromuscular, with serous carcinoma within the wall and on part of the inner aspect of the cyst; no ovarian or fallopian tube tissue is identified in the sections examined.  There is also some tumour on the outer aspect of the cyst.  Sections from the region of the vaginal vault and the posterior cervix show extensive subserosal tumour.  No tumour is seen invading the vaginal cuff itself and the distal vaginal cuff margin is free of tumour.  The distal soft tissue margin in this region also appears to be free of tumour.\nThere is extensive tumour adherent to the serosa of the posterior uterus.  There is some tumour invasion of the outer myometrium of the posterior uterus, including some lymphovascular invasion in this region.  There is some serosal tumour on the anterior fundus of the uterus.  The endometrium is thin and inactive.  Leiomyomas are confirmed in the myometrium.\nSections of the right ovary and fallopian tube are unremarkable.\nSections of the perirectal tumour show similar serous carcinoma.  It is subserosal and there is no definite involvement of the rectal wall.\nSections confirm a subserosal tumour deposit on the sigmoid colon, 70mm from the proximal margin; this deposit does not involve the bowel wall.\nSections show multiple subserosal tumour deposits in the sigmoid mesentery.  Two unremarkable mesenteric lymph nodes are identified.  Some of the deposits in the mesentery may be replacing lymph nodes.\nC.  Sections confirm numerous subserosal tumour deposits on the small and large bowel, in the hilum of the spleen and elsewhere in the spleen.  A subserosal small bowel deposit closest to the proximal margin extends through the muscularis propria into the small bowel submucosa but the mucosa is intact.  Other serosal deposits on the small and large bowel do not involve the bowel wall.\nThe tail of pancreas is free of tumour.  One normal peripancreatic lymph node is identified.\nThe spleen is unremarkable, apart from the hilar and intra-parenchymal tumour deposits.\nA total of nine mesenteric lymph nodes are identified which are all free of tumour.  A few small extranodal tumour deposits are identified in the mesentery.\nD.  Sections show skeletal muscle and dense fibrous tissue with overlying serosa.

Each of the deposits appears clear of the splenic excision margin.\nSections of gallbladder show features of mildchronic cholecystitis, with no evidence of malignancy. No metastatic deposits are identified in the gallbladder. \nSections of right and left fallopian tube and right and left ovaries show changes consistent with age, with no evidence of involvement. \nSections of uterus show atrophic endometrium. The myometrium and serosal surface is unremarkable. \nSections of the omentum confirm a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with a similar appearance to those seen within the spleen. Central necrosis is present. \nC. Sections show smooth muscle consistent with muscularis propria, which merges with a cellular spindle cell nodule which appears circumscribed but unencapsulated. Within the nodule, the bland spindle cells show cigar-shaped nuclei arranged in intersecting fascicles.  This nodule is 4mm in maximal extent. There is no significant nuclear atypia, no necrosis, and no mitotic activity detected. The features raise a differential diagnosis of a small gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST), versus a leiomyoma, with the appearance on the routine stain favouring a small gastrointestinal stromal tumour. Immunohistochemical stains are in progress to differentiate these two lesions, with a supplementary report to follow. \nD. Sections of liver show mild macrovesicular steatosis.

Appendicectomy.\nMACROSCOPIC:\nA.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Large tumour in sigmoid mesentery retroperitoneal tumour stitch deep vascular margin&amp;#8221;, consists of a roughly ovoid tumour with a largely peritonealised grey/red smooth surface.  It measures 250 x 240 x 130mm and weighs 3.5kg.  There is an overlying length of attached bowel which is freely movable over one aspect of tumour and measures 270mm in length with a circumference of 70mm.\nThe cut surface of the tumour has a pale grey/tan flesh-like appearance, with scattered pale grey and pale yellow areas.  The large bowel mucosa is unremarkable. The bowel margins are inked blue and the peritonealised tumour surface is inked black.  The mesenteric surgical margin (marked with a suture) is also inked black.  No lymph nodes are identified within the small amount of attached pericolic adipose tissue.\nBlock 1- LS one colonic margin; 2- LS other colonic margin; 3 &amp;#8211; TS colon directly above tumour (the tumour is non-adherent to the bowel wall); 4-10 &amp;#8211; tumour and peritonealised surface; 11-25 &amp;#8211; representative tumour, including fibrous areas, presumed areas of necrosis, and possible fatty areas; 26-31 &amp;#8211; representative sections of fatty and vascular tissue adjacent to marking suture; 32-40 &amp;#8211; representative pericolic and mesenteric adipose tissue.\nB.  Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Appendix&amp;#8221;, consists of a vermiform appendix measuring 70 x 10 x 9mm, with attached mesoappendix measuring up to 35mm in width. The serosal surface is pale grey and shiny. There are no lymph nodes.\nBlocks 1 &amp;#8211; LS complete distal tip; 2 &amp;#8211; LS complete proximal end; 3-5 &amp;#8211; TS remaining appendix. Entire appendix embedded.     (TO: JB/ec 25.5.66)\n\nMICROSCOPIC:  (REPORTED BY DR D Luskin)\nA.  The 250mm tumour is a circumscribed unencapsulated spindle cell tumour, composed of mild to moderately pleomorphic spindle cells arranged in a storiform and pattern-less architecture, with scattered admixed haemangiopericytomatous (stag-horn like) vessels. In areas, the cellularity is moderate to high. There are scattered mitoses, up to 15 per 10 hpf, and occasional foci of tumour associated necrosis. No marked cytologic atypia is seen. No convincing lymphovascular space invasion is seen. Tumour focally abuts the peritonealised surface. There is patchy admixed mild chronic inflammation. The surrounding fibroadipose tissue shows mild variation in adipocyte size, however, no lipoblasts or cytologic atypia are seen.\nCOMMENT:\nImmunohistochemical stains were performed on the previously reported tumour core biopsy (INTENSIVE CARE UNIT S-16-02914) (CD99 and STAT 6+) and were not repeated.\nOverall, the morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical staining identified at RECOVERY is consistent with the diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumour. The clinical behaviour of solitary fibrous tumours may be unpredictable, however, the large size, increased cellularity, high mitotic rate (&amp;gt; 4/10 hpf) and presence of necrosis, portends more aggressive (malignant) behaviour in this case.\nGiven the retroperitoneal location of this tumour, the possibility of a STAT6 positive dedifferentiated liposarcoma with a solitary fibrous tumour-like morphology, cannot be entirely excluded1. Although no background features of liposarcoma are seen within the adjacent adipose tissue, if clinically indicated, supplementary FISH testing for MDM2 amplification can be arranged.\nB.  The appendix has been examined in its entirety. The appendiceal lumen is expanded by a faecolith. There is no evidence of acute appendicitis. No pathogenic organisms or granulomas are identified. There is patchy acute serositis most likely related to intra-abdominal pathology. There is no evidence of malignancy.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

There is focally very thin normal subcutaneous fat at the superficial margin and at the deep margin there is a thin layer of loose fibrous type tissue, consistent with tissue spanning a tissue plane of the fascia.    The lateral superficial margin inked blue, medial green and deep black.    Sectioning reveals a pale grey multinodular tumour which is mostly solid but also shows central cystic degeneration with myxoid material.

Specimen labelled \"Sigmoid colon/pelvic tumour\" consists of a segment of large bowel 300mm in length and varying circumference.  At one end of the bowel is a stapled margin, and the bowel is 90mm circumference.  The opposite stapled margin is shorter and appears to be submucosal, and the bowel at this end of 55mm circumference.  There is minimal attached mesocolon, 20mm in width.  \nWithin the mid section of the colon there is an adhesion between adjacent colon segments.  In the bowel adjacent to this adhesion there is a circumferential exophytic tan tumour, 70mm in maximum dimension.  The tumour is 120mm clear of the closest stapled margin.  The tumour perforates through the entire bowel wall thickness, with a transmural defect, 25 x 20mm.  Surrounding this defect there are serosal deposits of tan necrotic tumour, spanning an area 90mm across (inked black).  There is a large area of necrosis and probable tumour in the mesocolic fat which is entrapped between the adherent loops of bowel.\nOn the opposite serosal surface, also adjacent to thebowel adhesion there is haemorrhagic and fibrinous exudate 60 x 25mm.  Within the bowel there are two pedunculated mucosal polyps, both 7mm across. These polyps are at least 30mm clear of the closet stapled margin.  \nThere is deposition of haemorrhagic and fibrinous exudate adjacent to the end of bowel near the first stapled margin.  This area is 40mm across, and 25mm clear of the margin.  Haemorrhagic serosal deposits are also seen near the shorter stapled margin.Lymph nodes are difficult to identify within the mesocolon.  No apical lymph node is identifiable.  Also received are multiple fragments of necrotic tumour 60mm in aggregate.   \nBlocks:  1- bowel at stapled margin; 2 & 3 - two mucosal polyps; 4 & 5 - edge of tumour with uninvolved bowel; 6 to 8 - bowel with tumour at site of perforation; 9 - tumour with adherent loops of bowel; 10 - tumour at site of bowel perforation; 11 - necrosis in mesocolon between adherent loops of bowel; 12 - opposite stapled margin; 13 - bowel with haemorrhagic serosal deposits near first staple margin; 14 & 15 - haemorrhagic serosal deposits near shorter stapled margin; 16 - one lymph node; 17 - multiple lymph nodes.  Specimen photograph taken; 18 to 26 - pericolic fat. \nC.  Specimen labelled \"?Appendix\" consists of an appendix received partially opened.  The appendix is 60mm in length and 17mm diameter.  There appears to be haemorrhagic tissue over the serosa.  The wall is 3mm thick.  The lumen contains haemorrhagic material.  No focal lesions are seen within the appendix.  \nBlocks:  1 to 3 - LS through distal/tip of appendix; 4 to 9 - TS serially embedded from tiptowards base; 10 - shave TS appendix adjacent to stapled margin.

(TO: SW:  SP/mm 7.4.65) \nMICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by A/Prof M Trippensee):  \nThe tumour was re-examined after assessment of the initial sections and extensive additional sampling of the pericolic fat was performed.\nThere is a circumferential moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma which has perforated through the wall of the colon. Adenocarcinoma is also present on the appendix (Specimen C) and within the wall of the upper abdominal abscess (Specimen D). A synoptic report is as follows:\n\nMacroscopic Description\n\nSite of tumour: Sigmoid colon\t\nMaximum tumour diameter:   70  mm\nDistance of tumour to nearer cut end:  120 mm\nTumour perforation:     Yes (pT4)\nMicroscopic Description\n\nType\nAdenocarcinoma NOS\nImmunohistochemistry: CK7 Negative, CK 20 Positive, CDX2 Positive.\n\nDifferentiation by predominant area\nModerate\nLocal invasion\npT4b\tTumour directly invades or is adherent to other organs or structures\nTumour involvement of margins\nCut ends: Not involved\nLymph nodes\nNumber of lymphnodes present: 3\t\nNumber of lymph nodes involved: 1\nThe specimen was re-examined and extensive sampling of the mesocolon was conducted.

At the site of perforation, viable tumour is present.\nThe serosal deposits consist of dense fibrous stoma, with foamy macrophages, reactive fibroblasts and granulation vessels. This is consistent with previous chemoradiotherapy effect.\nThe appendix (Specimen C) shows adenocarcinoma infiltrating into the muscularis propria.\nThe upper abdominal abscess (Specimen D) shows fibrous tissue, with foamy macrophages, chronic inflammatory cells and occasional giant cells. There are small residual cords of adenocarcinoma within the fibrotic tissue. This is consistent with partial chemoradiotherapy effect. \nThe reports of the previous biopsies of retroperitoneum are noted (Atmos Energy report 48N67773 and EXMOUTH HOSPITAL Hospital report MV56777326). The core biopsy from KING EDWARD MEMORIAL HOSPITAL has been obtained and reviewed in association with the current resection specimen.\nWithin the pericolic fat in the current resection there are areas of fat necrosis and reactive changes with variability in lipocyte size and focal nuclear hyperchromasia. There is associated fibrosis, inflammatory infiltration and aggregates of histiocytes. When seen in the broader context of the colonic resection these changes are consistent with inflammatory and reactive changes due to abscess formation. \nThese changes are similar to those seen in the previous biopsy and may account for the previous interpretation of atypia. \nResidual tumour status\nR2\tMacroscopic margin involvement\nResponse to neoadjuvant therapy\nGrade 3 (poorresponse) - Minimal or no tumour kill; extensive residual cancer\nMismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status\t\nMLH1\t\tPreserved nuclear staining\nPMS2\t\tPreserved nuclear staining\nMSH2\t\tPreserved nuclear staining\nMSH6\t\tPreserved nuclear staining\nComment:\nAbsence (loss) ofnuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.\nPreserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.\nSummary - TNM 7th Edition\npT4b     pN1     pM1     R2\t\n\nComment:This result was discussed with Prof M Greenawalt.

Cytoplasmic clearing is also seen in the apical cytoplasm in some areas. \nThe surface papillary tumour of the right adnexal mass shows a villoglandular morphology with columnar cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and with many cells showing apical cilia, mucin stains demonstrate some intracytoplasmic mucinous differentiation. Cytologic atypia including mitotic activity, multilayering/pseudostratification and nucleoli and mild nuclear shape variation seen. Polymorph neutrophils are seen within epithelium and within cystic space. Sections of the adjacent solid tumour show similar features but with more apical cytoplasm although ciliated cells are also seen. Apical cytoplasmic clearing is also seen insome areas. Complex architecture is seen in the solid areas. Large cystic spaces are lined by similar atypical epithelium. Tumour is also seen with small infiltrative glands  adherent to the posterior uterine surface and the anterior uterine surface, and in this region there is also adjacent endometriosis. In association with the infiltrating adenocarcinomathere is squamous differentiation with a desmoplastic stromal reaction (block A2). Endometriosis is also seen in this region. \nSections of the colon including the resection margins are unremarkable. Tumour is adherent to thepericolic/perirectal adipose tissue with villoglandular pattern tumour with a desmoplastic stromal reaction identified in this area. A small amount of psammomatous calcification is seen in association with the tumour.\nB.  The sections show lymph nodes. Negative for malignancy. \nC.  The sections show large bowel with normal morphology.\nD.  Sections of the appendix show serosal acute inflammation and serosal endometriosis/endosalpingiosis. \nE.  The sections show a small amount of fatty tissue with serosal acute and chronic infalmmation and mesothelial reaction and a small amount of infiltrating adenocarcinoma with desmoplastic stromal reaction. \n.  The sections show fibrofatty tissue in which there is endometriosis and endosalpingiosis and with infiltrating nodules of well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with well formed glandular spaces and desmoplastic stromal reaction. There is columnar cell morphology with apical cytoplasmic clearing. \nG. The sections show skeletal muscle with adipose tissue and fibrous tissue and this is infiltrated by a well to moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with glandular and partial villous architecture. There is columnar cell morphology with apical cytoplasmic clearing. In addition, areas of squamous differentiation are identified. \nH.  The sections show lobulated fatty tissue consistent with omentum with mesothelial reaction. There are also deposits of infiltrating adenocarcinoma with desmoplastic stromal reaction with glandular morphology with columnar epithelium. \nImmunohistochemistry (block G1): The tumour is positive for CAM5.2, and CK7. CK20 and CDX-2 are negative. CEA stains squamous differentiation in tumour. Pax-8 shows weak to modeate nuclear staining. Oestrogen receptor shows moderate to strong staining. Progesteroner eceptor shows pathcy positive staining. \nCOMMENT:\nThe appearances are those of an adenocarcinoma with mixed morphological features. There are features favoured to represent a predominant endometrioid differentiation (including cytoplasmic clearing imparting a so-called 'secretory' appearance), and with villoglandular architecture in many areas. The surface papillary component however has a somewhat 'seromucinous' appearance. In addition, focal areas of squamous differentiation in sections from the paracervical region and the wound nodule (consistent with squamous differentiation in endometioid adenocarcinoma). \nThere is endometriosis in several sections examined. \nOverall, the tumour is favoured to represent a well to moderately differentiated predominantly endometrioid adenocarcinoma with some mixed Mullerian differentiation. It is centred in the right adnexal region. \nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

Specimen labelled &amp;#8220;Abdominal sarcoma&amp;#8221; consists of a solid mass with an orientating suture indicating antero-superior.  The tumour is 170mm (superior to inferior) x 140mm (medial to lateral) x 130mm (anterior to posterior).  The specimen weighs 1436g.  At the superior aspect of the tumour, adjacent to the orienting suture, there is attached adipose tissue, 65 x 35 x 15mm.  Over the inferior portion of the anterior surface is a roughened area, 60 x 50mm, corresponding to the area of the tumour adjacent to the bladder wall.  The remainder of the surface of the tumour appears smooth and intact.  The tumour margin adjacent to the bladder wall is inked blue.  The remainder of the anterior margin is inked black, posterior margin green, and superior margin red.  The specimen is serially sectioned from superior to inferior into eight slices.  Slice one (superior) was subsequently sectioned in the sagittal plane from left to right into ten slices.  The area adjacent to the bladder wall is present in slices three to six.  Overall the cut surfaces have a gelatinous and fleshy tan appearance.

Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Left testicle and cord&amp;quot; consists of a testicle, 60 x 45 x 35mm, with attached spermatic cord, 85mm in length and 15mm across.  Midway along the spermatic cord is an attached solid mass, 70 x 50 x 55mm.  The specimen weighs 144g in total.  The tunica overlying the testis is smooth and intact, with a small amount of serous fluid between the layers of the tunica.  The testis is 35 x 35 x 25mm and appears normal.  The epididymis is 45 x 10 x 10mm.  The external surface of the spermatic cord mass appears smooth and intact.  The mass is well clear of the spermatic cord margin.  The cut surface of the spermatic cord mass has a multinodular pale yellow appearance.  Some of the nodules have a firmer consistency, affecting approximately 40% of cut surfaces.  No definite haemorrhage or necrosis is identified.  The external surface of the mass is inked black.\nBlocks:  1 - spermatic cord margin shave TS; 2 - TS spermatic cord adjacent to mass; 3 - spermatic cord adjacent to testis; 4 - testis and epididymis; 5 - superior part of testis; 6 - testicular hilum; 7 to 11 - firmer areas of tumour; 12 to 14 &amp;#8211; pale yellow areas of tumour.  Specimen photograph taken.  (TO: KT:  KT/mm 21.1.65)\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr Z Cavallario):\nA.  The sections of the abdominal mass show a 170mm well-differentiated liposarcoma with a mixture of inflammatory and sclerosing morphology.  The majority of the tumour appears surrounded by a thin band of fibrous tissue.  Sclerotic fibrous septae extend through the tumour imparting a vague multinodular appearance.  The tumour contains prominent myxoid stroma with a lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate and scattered thin-walled blood vessels.  The tumour is generally hypocellular and shows atypical spindled to stellate cells embedded within myxoid stroma and bands of fibrous tissue.  These cells have enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei with occasional multinucleated forms.  Up to 2 mitoses per 10 HPF are identified.  The haemorrhagic areas noted macroscopically may correspond to the core biopsy site, and shows a slight increase in cellularity, aggregates of neutrophils and a small organising thrombus.  The tumour has been extensively sampled and no dedifferentiated component is identified.  No established tumour necrosis is seen.  No convincing lipoblasts are identified.\nIn the area identified as off the bladder wall there is a disc of adherent smooth muscle, consistent with detrusor muscle.  The tumour abuts the detrusor muscle over a broad front, however no definite detrusor muscle invasion is seen.  The tumour is clear of the inked bladder wall margin, however focally involves all other margins.  Within the inferior aspect of the tumour, there is a segment of entrapped vas deferens.\nB.  The sections of the 70mm spermatic cord mass show a well-differentiated liposarcoma with a mixture of inflammatory, sclerosing and lipoma-like morphology.  The tumour has areas composed of variably sized adipocytes with rare lipoblasts.  Other areas contain a dense lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory infiltrate and areas of sclerotic fibrous tissue with scattered enlarged atypical hyperchromatic nuclei.  Mitoses are not readily identifiable.  No tumour necrosis is seen.  No dedifferentiated component is identified.\nThe main tumour mass extends to the inked surgical margin.  Atypical tumour cells are also seen extending throughout the length of the spermatic cord, as well as insidiously infiltrating into the epididymis, efferent ductules and tunica albuginea.\nAn incidental appendix epididymis is seen.  The testicular parenchyma shows no significant abnormality.\nRepresentative sections seen with Dr Z Keasey.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA &amp;amp; B.

Specimen labelled \"Sarcoma left arm, short superior, longlateral, double radial head, loop olecranon\" consists of an ellipse of skin measuring 160 x 100mm to a depth of 30mm.  There are four marking sutures in situ as described (orientated by Dr Elias ZABAWA, surgical registrar).  The deep margin includes skeletal muscle and fascia. The deep surfaces reveals a tumour which appears to be composed of two nodules.  Located closest to the superior margin is an exposed nodule in which the overlying fascia has been surgically divided. This nodule measures 45 x 40mm and is located 12mm from the medial margin and 40mm from the superior margin. There is a second nodule which is palpable beneath the skeletal muscle margin measuring 55 x 55mm and is located 4mm from the medial margin and 25mm from the inferior margin.  The lateral marginis inked blue, medial margin black, exposed tumour face inked yellow, radial head inked red and olecranoninked green.  \nOn sectioning the tumour appears well clear of the superficial margin (>50mm) and well clear of the lateral margin (> 30mm). The tumour appears to abut the medial margin.  Nodules one and two appear to be a continuous single tumour.  The tumour is approximately 35% myxoid (slices five to slices eight), 30% solid and fleshy (slices 9-11) and 35% soft cream and necrotic (slices 12-16).

(CQ/ta 25/7/63) \nMICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr C Vanalstin)\nThe specimen has been extensively sampled.  Sectionsshow a pleomorphic high grade undifferentiated sarcoma nearing approximately 95mm in maximum dimension. The tumour is centred within the deep subcutis, penetrates fascia and infiltrates skeletal muscle (eg block 27) in several areas. Thedermis is uninvolved.  The tumour has a partly infiltrative and partly circumscribed profile with relatively hypocellular areas associated with myxoid stroma and more cellular areasdisplaying storiform or fascicular growth within a fibrous stroma.  The tumour is composed of moderate to markedly pleomorphic spindled, stellate and epithelioid cells within a variably fibrous or myxoid stroma. There are capillary sizedvessels, some of which are thick walled.  There are numerous admixed tumour giant cells with hyperchromatic pleomorphic nuclei, many of which have intranuclear inclusions and eosinophilic macronuclei.  In some areas the tumour cells have abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm imparting a rhabdoid-like appearance.   The adipose tissue away from the advancing front of tumour is mature with no significant variation in size and no lipoblasts identified.  The morphological appearances are similar to those of the previous core biopsy (15W55938), in which no specific line of differentiation was identified (Negative for S100, HMB45, MelanA, PANCK, AE1/AE3, SMA, Desmin).  Myogenin immunostaining is also negative. Thetumour remains mitotically active (4 per 10 HPF).  There is minimal response to therapy with only minimal necrosis (block 37) and focal areas of acute and subacute haemorrhage.  \nThe tumour margins are as follows: \nDeep:  Positive (blocks 22, 41, 47, 48 and 49) including a focus across a broad front of approximately 11.5mm (block 41), deep to fascia, adjacent to muscle.  \nMedial :  Positive  (blocks 22, 27, 29); predominantly at the level of the deep subcutis, just above the fascia.\nOlecranon head soft tissue:  Indefinite; the area identified as the olecranon head marginis positive (blocks 27 and 29), however, it is located in subcutis, above the level of the fascia, and possibly represents a medial margin.\nRadial head soft tissue: 1.6mm clear (block 50)\nInferior: 3.5mm clear (block 47)and lateral:  Well clear (>10mm)\nThe tumour also extends to the defect in the triceps fascia at the deep aspect of the specimen (block 22).\nNo lymphovascular invasion or definite perineural invasion is seen.  \nB.  Sections show fascia with attached adipose tissue.  There is a small amount of attached skeletal muscle.  There is a focus of tumour within fibroadipose tissue abutting fascia anda focus suspicious for involvement of partially atrophic skeletal muscle.   \nDIAGNOSIS:  \nA.  \"Sarcoma left arm\":  \n- 95mm pleomorphic high grade undifferentiated sarcoma with positive margins (see above). \nB.

Strong family history of breast cancer.  Her mother is currently suffering from breast cancer and her grandmother died of breast cancer.  \nMACROSCOPIC:\nSpecimen labelled \"Left breast lesion with hook wire marking stitch short superior, long lateral, medium medial\" consists of a piece of breast tissue with three marking stitches and a guide wire measuring 55mm (lateral to medial) x 60mm (superior to inferior) x 20mm (superficial to deep).  There are two guide wires within the specimen.  Margins are inked in three colours:  superior - red, superficial - blue and deep - black.  Specimen is serially sectioned into ten slices from lateral to medial.  There is an ill defined tan nodule tan nodule 9 x 20 x 12mm in slices three and four.Separate from this lesion is slice five there is an 11 x 10 x 10mm tan firm nodule.

Sections show a spectrum of intraduct proliferative lesions including columnar cell hyperplasia, florid epithelial hyperplasia of the usualtype and multiple papillomas with superimposed florid epithelial hyperplasia.  Fibrous core biopsy tracts with adjacent subacute haemorrhage are identified (block 15, 18 and 20).  The two firm areas identified grossly within slices threeand four correspond to a 5mm sclerosing fibroadenoma with mild epithelial hyperplasia and focal glandular calcification and two adjacent intraduct papillomas, each about 4mm in dimension. One of the papillomas abuts the superficial marginat the junction with the inferior margin (block 7). The fibroadenoma is 4mm clear of the closest (deep) margin. The fibroadenoma lacks the columnar cell hyperplasia seen in the core biopsy specimen (36Q39577- specimen B), the latter morelikely corresponding to one of the benign epithelial proliferative lesions described.  A cluster of multiple intraduct papillomas, many with florid epithelial hyperplasia, is present towards the medialaspect of the specimen across approximately three consecutive slices reaching both the inferior and medial margins (block 22 & 23).  A myoepithelial cell contribution is confirmed with CK5/6 immunostaining demonstrating a benign mosaic pattern of staining. The breast tissue also shows cystic change, apocrine metaplasia, several foci of sclerosing adenosis and a focus of hyperplastic pregnancy like change (block 6).  Numerous benign glandular calcifications are present.Some of the intraduct proliferative lesions show superimposed mild architectural atypia, however, the features fall short of definite atypical ductal hyperplasia.

According to the WHO \"Pathology and Genetics of Head and Neck Tumours, 2005\", the presence of intravascular tumour cells in association with pleomorphic adenomas does not necessarily infer malignant potential.\nTumour abuts the inked surface of the specimen.

Whilst there is general agreement that this represents a pleomorphic adenoma, some pathologists,such as myself and Dr I Hackerott would regard this as a cellular variant of benign pleomorphic adenoma (with some atypical metaplasia) whereas other pathologists (Drs I Rosan and I Jerding) are concerned that there may be malignancy arising within a pre-existing pleomorphic adenoma.\nI have discussed these findings with Dr I Kano, ENT Registrar, and the case has been referred to A/Prof LYNWOOD JAKUBIAK, HARVEY DISTRICT HOSPITAL Hospital for expert opinion.\nFurther sections are also in progress.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

The capsule contains residual salivary gland ducts with associated fibrosis and collections of chronic inflammatory cells.  The tumour exhibits a varied morphologic pattern with cellular areas alternating with loose, myxoid and chondromyxoid stroma.  In addition central areas of marked stromal hyalinisation are identified. The cellular areas contain sheets of myoepithelial cells withinterspersed ductal structures.  The ducts exhibit a biphasic arrangement with inner ductal cells and abluminal myoepithelial cells.  The myxoid areas contain spindled, stellate as well as plasmacytoid appearing myoepithelial cells.  The myoepithelial cells have large, vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Mild nuclear pleomorphism and occasional mitoses are noted.  Focally necrosis is observed with associated granulation tissue and fibrosis.\nThe tumour abuts the soft tissue plane of excision focally.  In addition, focal intravascular tumour is noted within the fibrous capsule.\n\nCOMMENT:\nAtypical pleomorphic adenomas exhibit some features that raise concern about the potentialbiologic behaviour; however these features are insufficient on their own to attest malignancy.  These include intravascular tumour in small vessels in or adjacent to the capsule as well as cytologic atypia.\nDIAGNOSIS\nRIGHT PARAPHARYNGEAL TUMOUR: ATYPICAL PLEOMORPHIC ADENOMA.\nThis case was also reviewedby A/Prof I Tadesse, MONTO HOSPITAL's Hospital, COBAR who reports:\n\"Multiple sections show a pleomorphic adenoma with focal oncocytic changes, focal crypt formation and focal infarction (there is a history of recent FNB). There are rounded tumour extensions and fragments of tumour cells in vessels, without endothelial cover or vessel attachment, in soft tissue external to the fibrotic pseudocapsule. There is no true vascular permeation. Fragments of parotid glandare attached focally. There is no tumour at the inked superficial margin.\nCONCLUSION: Pleomorphic adenoma; left parapharyngeal region.\"\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 30U948636P\nMEDICALRECORD: 3079486.IPP\nPATIENT: Ponyah, ELMO\nIDNUM: 30U94863\nSTREET: Claypits\nCITY: PEREGIAN BEACH\nSTATE: QLD\nZIP: 3419\nDATE: 10/2/2027=>2027-02-10\nTIME: 13/09/2012 at 12:25=>2012-09-13T12:25\nDEPARTMENT: Radiation Oncology\nHOSPITAL: DORRIGO MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE\nDOCTOR: Jeffry Reuben FISCHEL\nDATE: 5.3.63=>2063-05-03\nDURATION: 6years=>P6Y\nDOCTOR: IT\nDOCTOR: QG\nDATE: 16/11/62=>2062-11-16\nDOCTOR: I Didio\nDOCTOR: I Hackerott\nDOCTOR: I Rosan\nDOCTOR: I Jerding\nDOCTOR: I Kano\nDOCTOR: LYNWOOD JAKUBIAK\nHOSPITAL: HARVEY DISTRICT HOSPITAL\nDATE: 5.3.63=>2063-05-03\nDEPARTMENT: DICKINSON 2 NORTH\nDEPARTMENT: Pathology West\nDOCTOR: ROSCOE HINDIN\nDOCTOR: I Tadesse\nHOSPITAL: MONTO HOSPITAL\nCITY: COBAR\n"}]}

Corresponding paraffin blocks, A9 and A13 are also received along with a copy of Dr Gavalis's report.\nThe report indicated that 5 specimens were received:\n1. A left hepatectomy distended by nodular tumour 130 x l20 x 90mm which showed solid and cystic areas on sectioning as well as areas of haemorrhage.\n2. Fragments of liver 15mm and 10mm maximal dimension labelled as coming from \"segment 5 liver\".\n3. An irregular fragment of liver 60 x50 x 40mm labelled as coming from \"segment 7/8 of liver\" containing an ill-defined white soft lesion 30mm diameter.\n4. An irregular tissue fragment 25 x 20 x l0mm labelled as \"pancreatic tumour\".\n5. A macroscopically normal gallbladder.\nMICROSCOPIC DESCRIPTION\n1. As reported, the large- mass in the hepatic left lobe is metastatic neuroendocrine tumour.  Part of the tumour shows the usual morphology which is predominantly of acinar type but with some trabecular areas.  However, much of the tumour also contains a second component which comprises an abnormal stromal proliferation. The stromal proliferation is most cellular around acinar structures which instead of being back-to-back are separated by the stroma but form nodular aggregates or elongated trabecular aggregates of these acini.  Further away from the epithelial elements, the stroma becomes less cellular and in some areas more myxoid with cells becoming much more spindling.  In the most cellular areas, the stromal proliferation comprises round to oval nuclei with moderately abundant clear vacuolated eosinophilic cytoplasm.  Mitoses are frequent (up to 5 per high power field) and there is some apoptosis.  No particular cytoplasmic differentiation is identified and no particular morphological evidence of rhabdomyosarcomatous differentiation is seen.  This sarcomatous stroma appears to be confined to the nodule within the liver which appears reasonably well circumscribed.  Centrally within the nodule, there is quite extensive necrosis with cystic degeneration and some\nhaemorrhage.\nThe provided immunohistochemistry confirms the neuroendocrine nature of the tumour in the epithelial componentshowing a typical CK7 and CK20 negative cytokeratin profile and positive staining for chromogranin A, Synaptophysin, CD56 and neuron specific enolase.  There is diffuse positivity for CDX-2 and very focal positive staining of some neuroendocrine cells for both serotonin and somatostatin. TTF-1, insulin, glucagon and gastrin are negative.  There is no evidence staining of the stromal proliferation for cytokeratins (PanCK, AE1/AE3, CAM5.2, CK5/6) but there is diffuse staining of the stromal component for vimentin.  There is some positivity for smooth muscle actin but much of this appears related to proliferating blood vessels and there is a similar, although possibly more widespread staining for desmin.Myogenin is negative, as are S 100 and CD99.\nAdditional and repeat immunohistochemistry has been done at NAREMBEEN HOSPITAL. Cytokeratins AE1/AE3 and CAM5.2 show staining of the neuroendocrine component but no staining of the stromal component.  There is also totally negative staining for cytokeratins 5, 7 and 20, high molecular weight cytokeratin 34BE12 and p63. Neuroendocrine markers chromogranin A, synaptophysin and neuron specific enolase are strongly positive in the neuroendocrine component but show no staining of the stromal component.  CD56 at ORROROO CAMPUS is only weakly positive (?different clone of antibody).  There is very weak patchy positivity for S100.  Due to the very primitive nature of the stromal proliferation, germ cell markers were done. Alphafetoprotein, placental alkaline phosphatase and CD30 are negative.  CD117 is negative.  CD99 shows a weak non-specific pattern of staining.  Smooth muscle actin shows positivity in blood vessels only (a less marked reaction than the SOUTHERN YORKE PENINSULA HEALTH SERVICES stain) and desmin is essentially negative although there is some positivity in spindle cells in areas which appear degenerate and ischaemic, a finding that is difficult to interpret.  Mycogen is negative.  CD31and CD34 show a fine vascular network throughout the tumour only.  \nStaining with somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) shows focal cytoplasmic and membrane positivity within the neuroendocrine component of the tumour although the reaction is fairly weak generally.  \nHowever, glucose transporter I (GLUTI) is negative.  Positive staining with (GLUTI relates to FDG positivity on PET while SSTR2 positivity relates toGaTate positivity on PET.  It would be interesting to know what the degree of avidity on PET for both these was prior to surgery.\nKi-67 estimation using the ROSEBUD HOSPITAL stain is estimated at 22% on the neuroendocrine component.  This is counting a hot spot in block A9 with 153/693 cells being positive. There is no defined standard as to the number of cells counted with recommended numbers varying between 500 and 2000.  The tumour is therefore, technically grade 3, although just so.  It is possible that if a larger number of cells were counted, the count would be below 20%.  The Ki-67 of the stromal component varies considerably averaging about 50% but in some areas getting up to 70-80%.\n2&3. Two further hepatic metastases of neuroendocrine tumour, neither showing a stromal component.  The morphology of the tumour is similar to the neuroendocrine component of the large metastasis.\n4. Sections show a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumour with predominant acinar pattern with areas of sclerosis and calcification.  No evidence of a stromal component is seen. Ki-67 is considerably lower in the primary being 3% (24 of 833 cells counted).\n5. Normal gallbladder.\nCOMMENT\nThe morphology of the stromal component in the large metastasis within the left lobe of liver is of high grade sarcoma, NOS.  It appears to be intimately involved with the neuroendocrine component of the tumour with it surrounding and separating the neuroendocrine components of the tumour where stroma is predominant within the nodule.  Mitotic rate is high and there is necrosis.  The sarcomatous stroma appears confined to the metastasis and is not seen in two other hepatic metastases or in the primary neuroendocrine tumour.\nThis is a distinctly unusual finding.  I have not seen this type of stromal proliferation in relation to any neuroendocrine tumours of gastroenteropancreatic type, nor can I find literature in relation to this whether relating to hepatic metastasis or primary pancreatic, gastric or enteric tumours of neuroendocrine type.  Tumours of this pattern have been described rarely in bladder, lung and thymus.\nIn both bladder and lung, this sort of sarcomatoid stroma is usually associated with high grade neuroendocrine carcinoma, either small cell or large cell type. However, in the thymus, there are rare cases of lower grade neuroendocrine tumours (thymic carcinoid) with accompanying sarcomatous stroma.  A case is illustrated in the WHO Blue Book Tumours of the Lung, Pleura, Thymus and Heart (2004), p 192-193.  The comment is made that these cases pursued a highly aggressive clinical course.\nThe terminology is confusing, depending on the organ system that is being addressed, but it would seem reasonable to regard the metastasis in the liver as having biphasic differentiation, possibly being called neuroendocrine carcinosarcoma or sarcomatoid neuroendocrine carcinoma.  This case may be worthy of a case report in that itis a distinctly unusual finding and the literature is silent.  As there is no literature, it is not possible to predict outcome but to my mind it would be likely be considerably less favourable than if the sarcomatoid component was not present.\nPETER MAC PATHOLOGIST OPINION\n1. Left hepatectomy:  Large deposit of metastatic pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma, grade 3 (Ki67 22%), with prominent high grade sarcomatous stroma (neuroendocrine carcinosarcoma).\n2&3.

Fungating breast cancer left breast.  Long history of breast cancer, untreated, known liver and lung mets.  Breast Ca.\nAdditional information:\nDr Reed (pathology registrar) confirmed with Dr Dorsey(surgical registrar) that the specimens are unoriented.\nMACROSCOPIC:\nA.  Specimen labelled \"Left breast\" consists of an unorientated,  irregular breast 270 x 250mm to a depth of 130mm. Skeletal muscle forms the deep margin of the specimen in some areas.  There is a large fungating ulcerated tumour measuring 220 x 170mm which has destroyed and replaced the nipple areolar complex and the majority of the surrounding skin; ulcerated tumour is 10mm from the closest radial cutaneous margins skin margin.  Sectioning reveals a poorly circumscribed cream tumour with extensive areas of necrosis.  The tumour invades the skeletal muscle and appears to abut the deep margin in several areas.   The tumour appears to extend to the superficial margin and the radial resection margins.  \nBlocks:  1 - tumour to deep margin; 2- tumour to skin; 3 to 5 - further representative tumour; 6 - tumour to skin radial margin; 7 to 14 - further representative tumour and margins.\nB.  Specimen labelled \"Left axillary contents\" consists of an unoriented, irregular piece of tan and fatty tissue,  95 x 80 x 45mm.  The cut surface reveals multiple lymph nodes, many of which are replaced by cream tumour. The largest involved lymph node measures 55mm in maximum dimension.  An estimated twenty lymph nodes are identified, however, the exact count is difficult to assess as many of the lymph nodes are matted together by tumour. The tumour appears to abut the resection margin of the specimen.  Representative sections in 8 blocks.  \n(TO:  JQ:  IB/mm 21.6.63) \nMICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr U Swanston & Dr U Hsia)\nA & B.  Sections show a 220mm, fungating, ulcerated, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  The carcinoma is arranged in dissecting sheets and solid nests with associated stromal desmoplasia and extensive necrosis.  No well formed tubules are seen.  The carcinoma extensively ulcerates skin, destroying the nipple areolar complex, replaces much of the breast tissue and infiltrates skeletal muscle reaching the deep margin. The mitotically active tumour cells have large pleomorphic nucleoli, irregular nuclear membranes, vesicular chromatin and eosinophilic macronucleoli. Although in areas the tumour has asquamoid appearance, no intercellular prickles or keratinisation indicative of squamous differentiation are seen, and dPAS stains highlight scattered glandular lumina both betweenand within cells consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The small amount of sampled residual breast lobules show no evidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).   Numerous foci of lymphovascular invasion are seen within the dermis (A2), breast and extranodal tissue of the axilla. The tumour extends to the superficial, radial and deep resection margins.\nApproximately seventeen of twenty one (17/21) axillary lymph nodes contain metastatic poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with similar appearances to the breast tumour.  There is extensive extranodal involvement including infiltration of axillary skeletal muscle, mainly via extensive extranodal lymphatic spread. The carcinoma extends to the resection margin of the axillary specimen.\nImmunohistochemistry:\nThe breast tumour cell stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7, CK20, TTF1 (patchy weak), E Cadherin.\nNegative:  ER, PR, CK5/6, Napsin A.\nEquivocal:  HER2  (2+).\nThe left axillarymetastasis stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7, CK20, TTF1 (diffuse moderate), ER (20% predominantly weak intensity).\nNegative:  PR, Napsin A.\nThe Ki67 proliferation index of the breast tumour is approximately 50-60%.\n\t\nCOMMENT:\nThe morphology of the currentbreast tumour and axillary metastasis match those of the previously excised left breast tumour (core biopsy - 80V36805) and left axillary lymph node metastasis (excision biopsy - 80V36805). \nA lung primary was suggested as the site of origin of the previously sampled left axillary metastasis based on the reported immunoprofile (80V36805 - CK7 positive, CK20 positive, TTF1 positive, ER negative).  The previously sampled left breast tumour (80V36805), in a more limited sample, was CK7 positive, TTF1 minimally positive, CK20 positive, ER positive (approximately 30% predominantly moderate intensity) and PR negative.  The current breast tumour specimen and axillary metastasis show similar positive immunoexpression for CK7, CK20 and TTF1.  The ER results in the current specimens are conflicting; the breast tumour is ER negative (tested twice with appropriate controls) and the axillary metastases ER positive.  Another marker for lung adenocarcinoma, Napsin A, is negative in both the breast tumour and axillary metastases, although poorly differentiated lung adenocarcinoma may lose expression.  In view of the advanced nature of the breast tumour, axillary location of metastases,and despite the lack of an identifiable in-situ component (the tumour has replaced much of the breast tissue), a breast primary (grade 3 ductal, NST) with axillary metastasis seemsmuch more likely than origin from a lung adenocarcinoma.  The TTF1 and CK20 results are interpreted as aberrant.  TTF 1 expression by breast carcinomas is very rare but has been reported with clone SPT24 used in this case.

Specimen labelled &amp;quot;Uterus&amp;quot;, consists of a uterus with attached cervix, weighing 96g in total.  The uterus measures 78 x 50 x 43mm and has a smooth serosal surface with two small yellow nodules on the posterior aspect, 8 x 7mm (adjacent to left cornu) and 6 x 5mm (superior to posterior peritoneal reflection). On the anterior serosal surface are four grey nodules, 1 to 3mm in extent.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 25mm and appears unremarkable.  On sectioning, the endometrium is 2 to 4mm in maximum thickness (greatest in the cervical canal) and the myometrium is up to 31mm; containing two fibroids, 6mm and 30mm in maximum diameter.\nBlocks:  E1 to E6 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; E7 to E9 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; E10 - right cornu; E11 - left cornu; E12 - yellow nodule near peritoneal reflection; E13 - yellow nodule near left cornu (bisected); E14 - anterior serosal nodules (two representative sections).\n\nF.

The attached fallopian tube is 58mm in length x 5mm in diameter and appears unremarkable with the exception of a 7mm parafimbrial cyst.  A 3 x 3mm yellow nodule is noted on the serosal surface of the soft tissue between the ovary and fallopian tube.  The ovary is sectioned transversely into 9 slices and shows a relatively well circumscribed 19 x 11 x approximately 20mm pale yellow lesion underlying the puckered serosal region (slices 4 to 8).

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Capitano):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr W Vaneekelen who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Erasmo comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

The uterus measures 78 x 50 x 43mm and has a smooth serosal surface with two small yellow nodules on the posterior aspect, 8 x 7mm (adjacent to left cornu) and 6 x 5mm (superior to posterior peritoneal reflection). On the anterior serosal surface are four grey nodules, 1 to 3mm in extent.  The ectocervix measures 35 x 25mm and appears unremarkable.  On sectioning, the endometrium is 2 to 4mm in maximum thickness (greatest in the cervical canal) and the myometrium is up to 31mm; containing two fibroids, 6mm and 30mm in maximum diameter.\nBlocks:  E1 to E6 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; E7 to E9 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; E10 - right cornu; E11 - left cornu; E12 - yellow nodule near peritoneal reflection; E13 - yellow nodule near left cornu (bisected); E14 - anterior serosal nodules (two representative sections).\n\nF.

The attached fallopian tube is 58mm in length x 5mm in diameter and appears unremarkable with the exception of a 7mm parafimbrial cyst.  A 3 x 3mm yellow nodule is noted on the serosal surface of the soft tissue between the ovary and fallopian tube.  The ovary is sectioned transversely into 9 slices and shows a relatively well circumscribed 19 x 11 x approximately 20mm pale yellow lesion underlying the puckered serosal region (slices 4 to 8).

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr W Baitner):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr W Schied who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Shannon comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

The pancreas is stapled at one end (presumably the proximal resection margin).  There is a suture next to the stapled line.  The pancreas is tapered towards its tip.  One surface is inkedblue and one surface is inked black.  Proximally there is a 37 x 22 x 15mm pale lobular indurated nodule.  The nodule abuts the blue inked surface and is 1mm from the black inked surface.  It almost abuts proximal stapled margin.  Slicing the omental tissue reveals few ?lymph nodes.\nBlocks: 1 to 17 - the entire pancreas from distal to proximal (block 8 reserved block); 14 to 17 - proximal nearmargin (after removing the staples);18 - possible lymph nodes; 19 to 22 - sections of omentum looking for lymph nodes.\n(TO: NJ;NU/vo 2.11.63) \nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof O Symon):\nSections of distal pancreas show extensive hyperplasia of the pancreatic islets which in some areas replaces the pancreatic parenchyma in a peripheral \"ring like\" fashion.  Residual benign ducts and occasional pancreatic acini are noted within the areas of hyperplasia.  \nElsewhere in the distal pancreas the hyperplastic islets have a more random distribution throughout the pancreatic parenchyma.  \nThe hyperplastic islets are associated with amyloid deposition which is confirmed in Congo Red and Crystal Violet stains.  \nThe hyperplastic islets, includingareas where they focally coalesce, show no significant nuclear atypia.  \nImmunohystochemistry shows a marked predominance of insulin staining cells within the hyperplastic islets, accounting for approximately 80% of the cell population. There is an admixture of glucagon positive cells, situated mainly around the periphery of the hyperplastic islets.  \nKi67 expression is low, staining approximately 1% of cells. \nThe exocrine pancreatic acini and ducts show no significant morphological abnormality.  Occasional pancreatic ducts show mild hyperplasia associated mild atypia, suggestive of PanIN-1.\nThe sections of omentum reveal a single benign lymph node.  \nentire pancreas has been embedded.  Three peripancreatic lymph nodes are identified, all of which show no evidence of malignancy.  \nSections taken from the proximal margin show pancreatic parenchyma with \ninterspersed hyperplastic islets.  \nComment:  The overall appearances would favour a diagnosis of pronouncedislet cell hyperplasia rather than a pancreatic endocrine neoplasm.  The distribution of the hyperplastic islets and the admixture of glucagon and insulin staining cells would support this interpretation.  \nIn addition the deposition of amyloid within hyperplastic islets is a known phenomenon in patients with diabetes and this finding should be correlated with the patients clinical and biochemical features, in particular evidence of hyperinsulinemia. \nThe features are unusual and the case has been refereed to BENDIGO HEALTH - THE BENDIGO HOSPITAL Hospital in LYNDOCH for further expert opinions.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nDistal pancreas:  Pronounced islet cell hyperplasia with predominance of insulin secreting cells.  \nAmyloid deposition identified within hyperplastic islets.\nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT, 5.5.2064\n\n\nReport from ROYAL MELBOURNE HOSPITAL - ROYAL PARK CAMPUS Hospital\nReported by: Prof Roosevelt VANVRANKEN (29.4.64)\nCLINICAL DETAILS\nM / 76 Slides of distal pancreatectomy for opinion.\nNATURE AND SITE OF SPECIMEN\n09-12-13 53R09008 1-6 H&E x6, 7 variously stained slides x8 (incl controls), 8-22 H&E x15 & paraffin block 53R09008 9\tReturn slides & block\n\nMICROSCOPIC REPORT\nSections of pancreas show diffuse islet cell hyperplasia. Prominent amyloid deposition is present in many islets. Occasional ductuloinsular complexes are seen, although these are not prominent.

In many areas the tumour displays an alveolar-like growth pattern and the tumour cells contain abundant granular and clear cytoplasm.\nThese changes, in combination with the patient's age, suggest that this carcinoma is an Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinoma. \nFuhrman grade: \n\t \n\tGrade 3 \tnucleoli prominent at 100x magnification \n\t \nSarcomatoid differentiation: Absent\nRhabdoid differentiation: Absent - Although many of the tumour cells have voluminous eosinophilic cytoplasm, no diagnostic evidence of high grade rhabdoid differentiation is seen.\nNecrosis: Present (20 - 25%)\nTumour spread beyond kidney: The carcinoma is bounded by a thin fibrous capsule which is focally disrupted posteriorly (block 3). Deeper levels have been examined and no definite invasion of perinephric fat is identified.\nTumour extends beyond Gerota's fascia: No\nTumour in renal sinus fat: No.  There is a circumscribed nodule of tumour which bulges into therenal sinus fat, bounded by fibrous tissue.

Attached to a uterus measuring 60x40x30mm , the cervix measures measuring 30x25x20mm.  Multiple adhesions are identified at the posterior uterus where the bowel segment is adherent. These adhesions are obscuring the normal anatomy of the right and left adnexal structures.  The possible right fallopian tube measures 25x10mm attached to a cystic right ovary measuring 45x40x35mm.  The left fallopian tube is not clearly identified but the left ovary is forming a mass measuring 95x60x45mm occuping the posterior aspect of the uterus, the mesenteric adipose tissue and extends to approach the right ovary.   Multiple serosal nodularities are identified on the left ovary outer surface.The cut surface confirms a solid , papillary and partially cystic tumor likely arising from the left ovary invading the posterior uterine wall, the mesocolon and crossing the midline to reach the right adnexal structures. The cut surface of the right ovary is solid and cystic with soft papillary excrescences.  The majority of the tumour has central areas of necrosis and haemorrhage.  The tumor abutting the free serosal surfaces of right and left ovaries. The tumor and possibly abutting the mucosal surface of the bowel with no definite ulceration into the mucosa. The cut surface of the right fallopian tube is unremarkable. Even after serial slicing of the tumor are, the left fallopian is not identified and is possibly embedded within the solid tumour areas.

The atypical mucinous epithelium shows intermediate to high grade nuclear features. A focal desmoplastic reaction is seen to some of these epithelial deposits, consistent with at least focal invasion of the serosa at the site of anastomosis. Also, sections of the colon show extensive deposits of extracellular mucin containing atypical mucinous epithelium, involving the serosa and mesentery, including the surface of the serosa and mesocolon. Because of the presence of at least focal desmoplastic reaction consistent with invasion, these deposits are in keeping with moderately differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.

Abnormal HRM traces are subjected to DNA sequencing for characterisation.  This assay is capable of detecting BRAF mutations providing the mutant allele is present at a level of 10% or greater.\nRESULT:  \tMUTATION DETECTED\n\t\tBRAF: c.1799T>A: p.VaI600G1u (V600E)\n\nINTERPRETATION\nThe p. Val600Glu (V600E) mutation in exon 15 of the BRAF gene was detected, which indicates that this tumour is unlikely to be sensitive to EGFR inhibitors.\nComments\nBRAF mutations are found in 5-20% of colorectal cancers and 30-70% melanomas, in the majority of cases (90% in melanoma) the mutation results in the V600E protein change [1.2].  V600E specific BRAF inhibitors (e.g. Vemurafenib) have been developed to inhibit oncogenic BRAF in melanoma patients.  Trials of Vemurafenib have shown that melanoma patients with the BRAF V600K mutation may also benefit from treatment [3].  The presence of a BRAF mutation in colorectal cancer can be used to rule-out Lynch syndrome and it also indicates that the patient will be insensitive to EGFR inhibitors e.g. cetuximab [4].\nPlease note:  Synonymous changes are not reported.\nReference articles: 1) Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer:\nhttp://sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/.2). 2)Gamett and Marais (2004) Cancer Cell; 6:313-319. 3) Chapman et al, (2011) N Engl I Med (364)26: 2507.16.4) Sharma et al, (2010) Arch Pathol Lab Med; 134: 1225-1228, Reference Sequence GenBankAccession Number: BRAF NM_004333.4\nThe nomenclature used is in accordance with the Human Genome Variation Society (HGVS) guidelines: www.hgvs.org.\n\nADDITIONAL REPORT, 5/7/63:\nSections were sent to Lowy Pathology,QLD for BRAF Mutation Analysis, the results of which are as follows:\nSummary:\nThe somatic BRAF mutation V600E was PRESENT in tumour DNA from this patient. This finding indicates that methylation of the MLH1 gene promoter may be present but should be interpreted in association with other laboratory and clinical findings.\nType of study: \nSomaticmutation test\nClinical details: cancer\nBackground:\nAbsence of MLH1 gene expression in a tumour can be due to heritable or somatic mutations in the MLH1 gene. Heritable mutations cause hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, or Lynch syndrome) whereas somatic mutations cause non-familial cancers. A common type of somatic mutation involving the MLH1 gene is epigenetic silencing due to methylation of the promoter; epigenetic mutations are rarely familial. Hence the loss of MLH1 gene expression due to promoter\nmethylation makes if very unlikely that the patient has a heritable mutation in the MLH1 gene.\nA specific somatic mutation in the BRAF gene, c.1799T>A (p.Val600Glu or V600E), is a useful surrogate marker for methylation of the MLH1 promoter in tumour tissue. The absence of the V600E mutation in tumour tissue is strongly associated (>95%) with absence of methylation of the MLH1 promoter. Absence of the V600E mutation is consistent with, but not diagnostic of, HNPCC.\nThe presence of the V600E mutation is associated (75%) with methylation of the MLH1 promoter. The presence of the V600E mutation indicates that HNPCC is unlikely but does not exclude other familial cancer syndromes.\nMethod:\nMutation testing is performed on DNA isolated from paraffin-embedded tumour tissue. A region including nucleotide 1799 is amplified by PCR and the presence of the T>Amutation is determined by a single nucleotide primer extension assay. This assay will detect a mutation that is present in 5% or more of cells tested.\nReferences:\nNCBI reference sequence BRAF: NM_004333.4.\nWeisenberger DJ et al.

The tumour consists of lobules and ribbons of stratified squamous epithelium which focally includes a few mucin containing goblet cells.  The squamous epithelium sits on a loose fibrous stroma.  Within the sheets and lobules of epithelium there are loose reticular areas consistent with stellate reticulum.  Some palisading is seen at the base of the epithelium but this is not particularly prominent.  There is focal calcification.  Some pieces of tumour have a somewhat papillary architecture.  There is no necrosis and there is no cytologic atypia or evidence of malignancy.  There is a moderate, patchy infiltrate of mixed chronic inflammatory cells in part of the stroma.  The appearances are of a craniopharyngioma.  \nImmunostains:\nBeta-Catenin:   Positive cytoplasmic staining of tumour cells.  No nuclear staining.  \nCytokeratin CAM 5.2:   Epithelium stains positive.\nKi-67:  Manyepithelial basal cells positive.  Very few positive cells elsewhere.  \nI favour this to be an adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma rather than a papillary craniopharyngioma.

Also, there is no aberrant nuclear staining for beta catenin and there is now positive BRAF staining.\nOverall, he favours this being a papillary craniopharyngioma rather than the adamantinomatous type.

The mucosa of the bowel appears flattened where the tumour is adherent.  The tumour does not appear to perforate through the bowel wall.  A separate adherent cystic mass is identified close to one of the bowel resection margins.  The cyst contains haemorrhagic mucoid material and has focal excrescences on its inner surface.

(YY/mm 21 6.62) \nMICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr H Beaudoin): \nA.   Sections of the ovarian tumour show that much of this is a high grade serous borderline tumour but in some areas the proliferation is very florid and the architecture is very complex, consistent with a component of low grade serous carcinoma.  The carcinoma is estimated to be around 40% of the tumour sampled.  The tumour consists of papillary structures and well formed glands lined by relatively uniform columnar epithelial cells with low grade nuclei.  There are auto-implants of serous borderline tumour on the surface of the ovary.  Sections of the fallopian tube show low grade serous carcinoma involving the fimbrial end and distending thedistal tube; the tumour is polypoid, projecting into the tube lumen, and no invasion into the tube wall is seen.  The tube elsewhere is unremarkable.  No high grade serous carcinoma is seen in the ovary or tube.  \nB.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable. Sections of the endometrium show that this inactive and shows some patchy pseudodecidual stromal change, consistent with exogenous hormone effect.  There are foci of adenomyosis and there are also leiomyomas in the myometrium.  The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.  There are scattered non-invasive implants of serous borderline tumour on the serosal surface of the posterior uterine wall and also focally on the anterior wall.  Sections of the fallopian tube are unremarkable.  Sections of the ovary show involvement by high grade serous borderline tumour and also some low grade serous carcinoma, similar in appearance to the tumour in specimen A.  The carcinoma is estimated to comprise around 20% of the tumour sampled.  There are auto-implants of serous borderline tumour on the surface of the ovary and also non-invasive implants focally on the serosa of the adjacent broad ligament.  \nC.  Sections show serous tumour which mainly has features low grade serous carcinoma.    \nD.  Sections show small bowel wall and adjacent omentum.  Multiple deposits of serous tumour are present in the omentum and involving the adjacent serosa of the small bowel.  There is minimal tumour involvement of part of the outer bowel wall but no involvement of the submucosa or mucosais seen.\nIt is not possible cytologically to distinguish between implants of serous borderline tumour and metastases of low grade serous carcinoma but the volume of disease, especially inthe omentum, would favour at least some of these tumour masses being metastases of low grade serous carcinoma.  \nRepresentative slides have also been viewed by Dr H Hardel. \nDIAGNOSIS:  \nA.Right ovary and tube:  \n1.

The specimen has been extensively sampled.  Sections show a epithelial predominant malignant mixed mullerian tumour (MMMT) centred within and replacing much of the right ovary, but also involving and expanding the lumen andwall of the right fallopian tube.  The tumour is predominantly (approximately 90%) composed of high grade serous carcinoma, however, a minority of the tumour (<5%) is associated with malignant stroma (A21) and by convention is classified as a MMMT.  No heterologous stromal differentiation is seen.  Approximately 10% of the tumour is poorly differentiated or shows clear cell differentiation (e.g. A20). A minute component of the tumour, sampled for frozen section showspossible squamous differentiation, however, no convincing endometrioid component is seen.  The carcinoma displays papillary, micropapillary and trabecular architecture and is composed of mitotically active cells with high grade nuclearfeatures.  There are extensive areas of necrosis.  The tumour extends very close to but does not appear to penetrate the serosal surface.  There is associated surface haemorrhage and mesothelial proliferation.  The carcinoma involves thewall of the fallopian tube it expands much of the lumen.  The fimbrial end of the tube is not identified.   No lymphovascular invasion is seen.\nB.  Sections show mature adipose tissue.  Three (3) minute lymph node show reactive changes only.  There is no evidence of malignancy.\nC.  The specimen has been entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of appendix show no significant abnormality.\nD.  The specimen has been entirely embedded and examined.

Around 60%of the tumour sampled has features of a well differentiated liposarcoma, both lipoma-like and sclerosing types.  Around 40% of the tumour sampled shows features of a dedifferentiated liposarcoma.  This consists of moderately cellular spindle cell tumour.  The spindle cells generally show only mild atypia and are haphazardly arranged in short fascicles.  However there are scattered more atypical mononuclear and multinucleate tumour cells and there are scattered mitosesidentified, including abnormal forms.  The background stroma in the dedifferentiated component is rather myxoid.  Some infarct-like necrosis is noted in dedifferentiated and sclerosing components but this is not prominent.  Some dense fibrosis, patchy metaplsatic ossification and focal calcification are noted within the well differentiated component.  \nBoth well differentiated and dedifferentiated components abut and indent the left kidney.  Kidney immediately adjacent to the tumour shows prominent interstitial fibrosis.  Further away from the tumour the kidney does not show any obvious abnormality.

The terminal ileum measures 50mm in length and 20mm in diameter. The right sided colon measures 65mm in length and 50mm in diameter.  In the region of the appendix, 45mm from the proximal and 65mm from the distal margin, there is a mucinous mass measuring 130x90x60mm. The normal appendiceal mucosa is completely obscured.  A segment of omentum 260x220x30mm is adherent to the right hemicolectomy.  Pericolic lymph nodes are difficult to identify, as most of the fat of the hemicolon is replaced by tumour.\n(1 LS of each margin; 2-6 full face section through appendiceal orifice [see diagram]; 7&8 further tissue of possible residual appendiceal mucosa; 9 tumour in adjacent fat; 10711 free mucinous mass; 12&13 tumour in omentum; 14 two representative right hemicolectomy lymph nodes).\nSmall Bowel - there are three segments of small bowel within the container.  The shortest measures 85mm in length and 50mm in diameter.  20mm from one of the margin an intussusception has formed secondary to a 55x45x20mm tumour deposit. It is difficult to determine whether the tumour is intraluminal or submucosal, although it has eroded the overlying mucosal surface.  In the overlying serosal surface there is a 15mm mucinous tumour deposit. The medium sized segmentof small bowel measures 180mm in length and 25mm in diameter.  It does not contain any obvious tumour deposits on the serosal surface, however, the lumen contains a large amount of blood.  The third, longest segment of small bowel measures 210mm in length and 20mm in diameter. There are multiple mucinous adhesions associated with the serosal surface.\n(15-20 shortest piece of small bowel with intussusception [15&16 LS of each margin, 17-20 full face of tumour at intussusception point]; 21&22 middle segment of bowel with the margin LS in 21; 23-25 longer segment of bowel with margins in block 23).\nThere is a segment of rectosigmoid bowel measuring 120mm in length and 15mm in diameter. Towards the peritoneal reflection there is mucinous tumour deposit on the serosal surface. The peritoneum is continuous with that surrounding the uterus and is also continuous and connected to a portion also containing the umbilicus.  The uterus does not contain the cervix and measures 40mm superior to inferior, 30mm medial to lateral and 30mm anterior to posterior. The tubes and ovaries appear to be present bilaterally but are obscured on the right side due to mucinous tumour deposit.  The umbilicus bearing skin ellipse measures 75x25mm.  There is a 25mm mucinous tumour deposit deep to the umbilicus.  \n(26 LS proximal rectosigmoid margin; 27 LS distal rectosigmoid margin; 28&29 mucinous tumour deposit in peritoneum adjacent to rectosigmoid; 30&31 RS uterus; 32 mucinous deposit on serosa near uterus; 33&34 right ovary with mucinous tumour [25mm]; 35 left tube and ovary; 36&37 tumour deposit in adjacent peritoneum; 38-40 full face of umbilicus).\nGallbladder - the gallbladder measures 55mm in length and 20mm in diameter.  It is hard and has a fibrous firm serosa.  It is impacted with multiple yellow gallstones measuring an aggregate of 30x30x20mm.  \nSpleen - the spleen weighs 155g and measures 100x70x40mm.  There are no obvious tumour deposits on its surface of within the parenchyma.  The splenic surface is pale in areas.\nThere are separate fragments of fatty, peritoneal and muscular tissue measuring an aggregate of 260x220x80mm. Within the fragments of tissue containing the probable diaphragm there is a possible previous cavity site measuring 70x35x5mm.  There are also lobules of free mucin which do not appear to be associated with other tissues.\n(41 TS gallbladder; 42 TS cystic duct and LS fundus of gallbladder; 43 RS spleen; 44 RS diaphragm; 45 RS possible cavity; 46 RS peritoneum; 47 RS free mucin).RS (M-47/KC/ank)\nMICROSCOPIC:  (K. Matye)\nRight hemicolectomy:\nSections from the gelatinous tumour in the appendiceal orifice show features of well-differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma.  The tumour comprises of mucin-secreting epithelium with basally located nuclei and focal pseudostratification.  The epithelium is embedded within large mucin pools.  There is invasion into the muscularis propria.  Mucinous material is identified throughout the adjacent mesentery.  The serosal surface appears congested and thickened.  Within the mesentery, microabscess formation is noted.  There is no normal appendiceal mucosa identified.  No convincing lymphatic permeation.  Both proximal small bowel anddistal colonic resection margins show no evidence of tumour.  No evidence of malignancy is seen in two lymph nodes identified.  \nSmall bowel:\nThe shorter bowel segment with intussusception shows mucinous adenocarcinoma similar to that seen the right hemicolectomy specimen.  The tumour is present in the bowel wall 10mm from one margin.  There is focal perineural involvement.  Tumour also extends into the fatty mesentery.  The serosa is oedematous, congested and shows active inflammation.  There is focal reactive mesothelial proliferation.  Focal changes suspicious for lymphatic permeation is identified.  The longer segment of bowel shows metastatic deposits of tumour on the serosal surface.  The mucosal margins appear clear of tumour.  \nSigmoid colon:\nThere is deposition of mucinous adenocarcinoma in the mesentery.  Uterine serosa also shows involvement by tumour.  Sections from the uterus show an endometrial polyp, inactive endometrium with foci of adenomyosis.  There is tumour with extensive mucinous deposition in the broad ligament.  Mucin pools are noted on the surface of the ovary and tube.  \nSections of the umbilicus show fibrous scarring with deposition of mucinous adenocarcinoma.  The gallbladder shows changes of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis and acute cholecystitis.  Mucin material is also present on the gallbladder serosa focally.  The spleen shows thickened capsule with active inflammation and mucin material is identified on the surface.  The splenic parenchymaappears unremarkable.  The diaphragm shows fibrous scarring with foreign body reaction and locules of mucin.  Sections of the peritoneum show  mucinous adenocarcinoma with extensive mucin deposition.  \nComment:  There are extensive change of well differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma involving appendiceal orifice, sigmoid colon, small bowel, uterine serosa, broad ligament, umbilicus and peritoneum.

The appearances are those of Grade 1 endometrioid carcinoma with a depth of invasion of the myometrium of 6mm in a total myometrial thickness of 14mm. There is no involvement of the cervix or serosa. Sections of parametrium and bilateral ovaries and fallopian tubes are within normal limits.\n\nB. Routinely stained sections (levels 1&amp;amp;2) of one of four lymph nodes show a small cluster of cells in the proximity of the lymph node sinus characterised by moderate nuclear pleomorphism with nuclear margin irregularities, variable nuclear chromasia and a single probable psammoma body. The cellular clusters are strongly positive for Cytokeratin AE1/3 (Level 1) and measure 0.5mm in maximum extent. The possibilities are that the clusters represents a micrometastatic focus of endometrial adenocarcinoma. Alternative possibilities include endosalpingiosis and a mesothelial  inclusion.

A WT1 immunstain on level 2 of the lymph node containing the cell clusters referred to in the original report is negative making mesothelial or serous differentitation unlikely. The cellular clusters may represent micrometastatic endometrial adenocarcinoma. However, a benign epithelial inclusion cannot be entirely excluded. There is no further tissue for additional immunostains.

(VP/ta 17/9/64) \n \nMICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr N Kvek)\nA.  Sections of the left mastectomy confirm the presence of two recent surgical cavities deep to the cutaneous scars at the 4 o'clock and 9-10 o'clock areas of the breast. In block two, adjacent to the surgical cavity at 4 o'clock, there is a 2.2mm collection of ducts showing partial expansion by atypical discohesive cells, most in keeping with ALH/LCIS. In block 7, within an area of fat necrosis adjacent to the surgical cavity at 9 - 10 o'clock, there is a 0.56mm focus of atypical ductal hyperplasia. Both theALH/LCIS and ADH are clear of margins (>10mm). In addition, there is a separate discrete focus of scarring associated with a prominent foreign body giant cell reaction, corresponding to the fibrotic area seen macroscopically at 2 o'clock 16cm FN, and most likely representing a previous site of biopsy/surgery. The surrounding breast tissue shows a spectrum of proliferative changes including fibrocystic change, columnar cell change, adenosis and apocrine metaplasia. Scattered suture granulomas are also present. Eighteen axillary lymph nodes show no evidence of malignancy (0/18). An incidental benign capsular lymph node inclusion is seen. There is no evidence of residual DCIS or malignancy. \nB.  Sections of the left low axillary lymph node show no evidence of malignancy (0/1). \n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.  Left breast and axillary lymph nodes:\nChanges consistent with recent surgical cavities (4 o'clock and 9-10 o'clock) and an additional focus of old scarring (2 o'clock).\nFocal ALH/LCIS and atypical ductal hyperplasia, clear of margins. \nNo evidence of malignancyin eighteen axillary lymph nodes (0/18). \n\nB.

Exon 11, 13 and 17 of KIT were assessed.  The sensitivity of the test is 20-30%. At least 20-30% tumour cells should be in the specimen to be confident of detecting a mutation if it is present. \nResult:\nExon 11\t\tNO MUTATION DETECTED.\nExon 13\t\tNO MUTATION DETECTED.\nExon 17\t\tNO MUTATION DETECTED.\nInterpretation:\nThe sample was NEGATIVE for mutations in exon 11, 13 and 17 of the KIT gene. This does not preclude the mutation being present in the mutant cell population if that population comprises less than 20% of the assayed sample.\nComment:\nMutations which affect the juxta-membrane domain (exon 11 and exon 13) of KIT result in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor, leading to enhanced cell proliferation.  It has been demonstrated that patients with gastro-intestinal stromal tumours with similar juxta-membrane domain mutations respond toimatinib mesylate (Heinrich MC, J Surg Oncol. 2005;90:195).\nReference sequence: \nKIT:N M_000222.2 (Nucleotide numbering for this report uses the A of ATG translocation initiation start codon as nucleotide 1).\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 66K761843Z\nMEDICALRECORD: 6637618.KJZ\nPATIENT: LAHREN, VAUGHN LEATRICE\nIDNUM: 66K76184\nSTREET: Chesnut\nCITY: GOONELLABAH\nSTATE: Tasmania\nZIP: 2210\nDATE: 2/8/1982=>1982-02-08\nDATE: 24/9/2063=>2063-09-24\nDEPARTMENT: SYDPATH\nHOSPITAL: GOOMALLING HOSPITAL\nDOCTOR: BONNY JOETTE BRANDENBURG\nAGE: 85\nDATE: Now=>2063-09-24\nDOCTOR: LM\nDATE: 25/9/63=>2063-09-25\nDOCTOR: Q Todorovich\nDATE: 1/9/63=>2063-01-09\nHOSPITAL: MACQUARIE HOSPITAL\n"}]}

In some areas, there are  intermediate nuclear features, including nuclear hyperchromasia, focal pseudeostratification, prominent nucleoli, and occasional mitotic figures. Architecture is simple, with a few papillae seen focally, but no cribriform architecture. There are multiple deposits of extracellular mucin containing strips of low to intermediate grade mucinous epithelium on the peritoneal surface. At the area of macroscopically ulcerated mucosa, similar tumour is seen within the mucosa and submucosa, with focal ulceration. A few foci of desmoplastic stromal reaction are seen in response to foci of atypical epithelium and a few irregular glands. In the sections of skin, mucinous tumour is seen within the dermis and subcutis (Block 7). Sections of the bowel wall on either side of the anastomosis show viable small intestine and colonic wall.

Specimen labelled Uterus/cervix/left tube/ovary\" consists of a uterus with attached cervix, left fallopian tube and ovary weighing 94g in total.  The uterus measures 80 x 50 x 35mm and on the anterior serosa has haemorrhagic and ?fibrinous material attached.  The ectocervix measures 25 x 20mm and appears unremarkable.  The endometrium is 2mm in maximal thickness and the myometrium is 23mm in maximal thickness.  The myometrium contains several fibroids up to 15mm.  All fibroids appear whorled and some are calcified.  The left fallopian tube measures 55mm in length with a maximum diameter of 5mm.  The left ovary measures 30 x 25 x 25mm.  The cut surface reveals a cyst, 20mm in maximum dimension, which is thin walled and has a smooth inner lining and contains green mucoid material.  There is roughened tan tissue on the surface of the ovary, ?tumour.  \nBlocks:  1 to 3 - full longitudinal section of posterior body and cervix; 4 to 6 - full longitudinal section of anterior body and cervix; 7 - further anterior uterus; 8 & 9 - representative tube; 10 to12 - representative ovary with attached cyst and ?tumour.\nC.  Specimen labelled \"Cul de sac\" consists of a tan haemorrhagic andfatty piece of tissue, 65 x 45 x 35mm.  There is peritoneum on three surfaces.  Apparent tumour is seen on the surface in several foci.  The cut surface reveals a haemorrhagic cream tumour involving the majority of the specimen.  Representative sections in 4 blocks.  \nD.  Specimen labelled \"Omentum and bowel\" consists of a segment of small bowel 110mm in length with an adherent omental mass measuring 180 x 80 x 55mm.  The mucosa of the bowel appears flattened where the tumour is adherent.  The tumour does not appear to perforate through the bowel wall.  A separate adherent cystic mass is identified close to one of the bowel resection margins.  The cyst contains haemorrhagic mucoid material and has focal excrescences on its inner surface.  The cut surface of the omentum reveals multiple creamy soft tumours, the largest measuring 70 x 50 x 40mm.  \nBlocks:  1 - resection margins; 2 to 5 - further representative sections; 6 to 9 - furtherrepresentative sections of omental mass and nodules.   (LJ/mm 21 6.62) \nMICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr Y Enrique): \nA.   Sections of the ovarian tumour show that much of this is a high grade serous borderline tumour but in some areas the proliferation is very florid and the architecture is very complex, consistent with a component of low grade serous carcinoma.  The carcinoma is estimated to be around 40%of the tumour sampled.  The tumour consists of papillary structures and well formed glands lined by relatively uniform columnar epithelial cells with low grade nuclei.  There are auto-implants of serous borderline tumour on the surfaceof the ovary.  Sections of the fallopian tube show low grade serous carcinoma involving the fimbrial end and distending the distal tube; the tumour is polypoid, projecting into the tube lumen, and no invasion into the tube wall is seen.The tube elsewhere is unremarkable.  No high grade serous carcinoma is seen in the ovary or tube.  \nB.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable. Sections of the endometrium show that this inactive and shows some patchy pseudodecidual stromal change, consistent with exogenous hormone effect.  There are foci of adenomyosis and there are also leiomyomas in the myometrium.  The myometrium is otherwise unremarkable.  There are scattered non-invasive implants of serous borderline tumour on the serosal surface of the posterior uterine wall and also focally on the anterior wall.  Sections of the fallopian tube are unremarkable.  Sections ofthe ovary show involvement by high grade serous borderline tumour and also some low grade serous carcinoma, similar in appearance to the tumour in specimen A.  The carcinoma is estimated to comprise around 20% of the tumour sampled.  There are auto-implants of serous borderline tumour on the surface of the ovary and also non-invasive implants focally on the serosa of the adjacent broad ligament.  \nC.  Sections show serous tumour which mainly has features low grade serous carcinoma.    \nD.  Sections show small bowel wall and adjacent omentum.  Multiple deposits of serous tumour are present in the omentum and involving the adjacent serosa of the small bowel.  There is minimal tumour involvement of part of the outer bowel wall but no involvement of the submucosa or mucosa is seen.\nIt is not possible cytologically to distinguish between implants of serous borderline tumour and metastases of low grade serous carcinoma but the volume of disease, especially in the omentum, would favour at least some of these tumour masses being metastases of low grade serous carcinoma.  \nRepresentative slides have also been viewed by Dr Y Bedward. \nDIAGNOSIS:  \nA.  Right ovary and tube:  \n1.  Serous borderline tumour and well differentiated (low grade) serous carcinoma of ovary.\n2.  Low grade serous carcinoma fimbrial end of fallopian tube.  \nB.  Uterus, left ovary and tube:\n1.   Serous borderline tumour and low grade serous carcinoma left ovary.  Non-invasive implants of serous borderline tumour on serosa of uterus and broad ligament.\n2.

(TO: SG  MR/mm 27.3.63) \nMICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr M Martiniz):\nA.  Sections show a grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC), Bloom and Richardson score 9 (t = 3, n = 3, m = 3).  The IDC is poorly circumscribed and is present in slices 6 to 10 (5 slices).  The estimated tumour size is 35mm (medial-lateral) x 30mm (superior-inferior) x 25mm (superficial-deep).  The superficial margin is positive in two (2) of the slices and the deep margin is close (clearance 0.6mm).  IDC also infiltrates close to the medial margin with tumour present in the most medial slice (slice 10).  However, the IDC 'cuts out' on levelling through this slice and the estimated clearance is 1mm.  The superior and inferior margins are both 4mm clear and the lateral margin is well clear (no tumour in slices 1 to 5).\nThere is a modest amount of high grade DCIS (solid, cribriform, comedo) confined to the IDC but not outside of it.  There is no DCIS close tothe excision margins.\nB.  The new inferior margin has been totally blocked and there is no DCIS or IDC.\nC.

Exon 11, 13 and 17 of KIT were assessed.  The sensitivity of the test is 20-30%. At least 20-30% tumour cells should be in thespecimen to be confident of detecting a mutation if it is present. \nResult:\nExon 11\t\tNO MUTATION DETECTED.\nExon 13\t\tNO MUTATION DETECTED.\nExon 17\t\tNO MUTATION DETECTED.\nInterpretation:\nThe sample was NEGATIVE for mutations in exon 11, 13 and 17 ofthe KIT gene. This does not preclude the mutation being present in the mutant cell population if that population comprises less than 20% of the assayed sample.\nComment:\nMutations which affect the juxta-membrane domain (exon 11 and exon 13) of KIT result in constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase receptor, leading to enhanced cell proliferation.  It has been demonstrated that patients with gastro-intestinal stromal tumours with similar juxta-membrane domain mutations respond to imatinib mesylate (Heinrich MC, J Surg Oncol. 2005;90:195).\nReference sequence: \nKIT:N M_000222.2 (Nucleotide numbering for this report uses the A of ATG translocation initiation start codon as nucleotide 1).\nSUPPLEMENTARY REPORT BRAF MUTATION ANALYSIS (28/8/64)\nReport from BOGGABRI MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE\nReported by Rademan, LAEL/LAPRISE, Van Mr\nRESULT\tNO MUTATION DETECTED\n\nINTERPRETATION\nNo BRAF mutation was detected at or surrounding codon 600 indicating that this patient will not respond to the current V600E specific BRAF inhibitors.\nFor full report see BLUE MOUNTAINS DISTRICT ANZAC MEMORIAL HOSPITAL accession number 71Z6773\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 71Z677321P\nMEDICALRECORD: 7196773.HEP\nPATIENT: FIGUEIRAS, Cory Qiana\nIDNUM: 71Z67732\nSTREET: Lydeard\nCITY: CENTRAL COAST\nSTATE: Western Australia\nZIP: 1226\nDATE: 2/8/1982=>1982-02-08\nDATE: 24/9/2063=>2063-09-24\nDEPARTMENT: CORONARYCARE UNIT\nHOSPITAL: KALGOORLIE HEALTH CAMPUS\nDOCTOR: JENNIFFER Zuri Swartzel\nAGE: 85\nDOCTOR: VM\nDATE: 25/9/63=>2063-09-25\nDOCTOR: T Labonne\nDATE: 1/9/63=>2063-01-09\nHOSPITAL: KALAMUNDA HOSPITAL\nDATE: 28/8/64=>2064-08-28\nHOSPITAL: BOGGABRI MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE\nDOCTOR: Rademan, LAEL\nDOCTOR: LAPRISE, Van\nHOSPITAL: BLUE MOUNTAINS DISTRICT ANZAC MEMORIAL HOSPITAL\nIDNUM: 71Z6773\n"}]}

Paraffin sections of fibroadipose tissue confirm the presence of adenocarcinoma composed of small irregular glands as well as numerous single tumour cells with an infiltrative pattern.\n\nB. Sections taken through the point of adhesion between small bowel and gallbladder show moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma consisting of small and large infiltrative glands which extend from small bowel mucosa, into the wall of the gallbladder and to the blue inked, smooth muscle surface of the specimen. Numerous signet ring cells are present. Suture material, consistent with previous surgery, is noted.\nThe tumour nodule marked by a double suture also shows adenocarcinoma present with the serosa between two separate layers of adherent muscularis propria. This tumour nodule also extends to the inked surface of the specimen.\nA separate serosal nodule of tumour is identified in block B8.\nPerineural invasion is present and foci of small vessel invasion are also identified.\nThe tumour shows positive staining with keratin 7 and keratin 19 but is negative for CDX2 and CD20. This profile would favour origin from an upper gastrointestinal origin rather than colorectum.\n\nThe sections taken from the bowel surgical margins show serosal inflammation and fibrosis but are clear of tumour.\nThe cystic duct margin is clear. The gallbladder mucosa shows extensive autolysis but there is no evidence of a primary gallbladder abnormality.\n\nC. The section of duodenal wall show a serosal deposit of adenocarcinoma which extends to the blue inked surface of the specimen. Carcinoma also invades superficially through the muscularis propria to extend into the submucosa. No connection to the overlying mucosa is seen.\nVascular and perineural invasion are seen.\nThere is a small amount of attached pancreatic tissue identified.\n\nD. The sections of rectum have fragmented making assessment of margins difficult.\nThere is a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma which appears to take origin from dysplastic colonic epithelium and invades through mucosa into superficial submucosa, consistent with a T1 tumour. There is no invasion of muscularis propria identified.\nNo definite vascular invasion is seen.\nThe carcinoma appears bounded by a zone of normal colonic mucosa but fragmentation makes assessment of the thickness of the margin difficult.\nThe appearances would favour a primary rectal adenocarcinoma, however, immunostaining is in progress,\n\nE. The sections of colonic mucosa show a possibly hyperplastic polyp.\nThere is no evidence of malignancy seen.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA. Peritoneal nodule around duodenum: Metastatic adenocarcinoma.\n\nB. Ileocolic resection and gallbladder: Metastatic adenocarcinoma extending to surface of specimen.\n\nC. Duodenal wall: Metastatic adenocarcinoma\n\nD.

The immunohistochemistry staining on the adenocarcinoma shows strong positive expression of CDX2 and focal expression of keratin 20. Areas of the tumour are keratin 20 negative.\nThe keratin 7 stain is essentially negative (particularly when compared to the strong expression seen in the duodenal wall tumour in specimen C).\nKeratin 19 also shows focal expression.\nThe overall pattern, particularly the strong CDX2 expression and negative keratin 7, would be in keeping with a colorectal primary.\n\nMismatch Repair Deficiency (MMRD) Status\nMLH1\t\tPreserved nuclear staining\nPMS2\t\tPreserved nuclear staining\nMSH2\t\tPreserved nuclear staining\nMSH6\t\tPreserved nuclear staining\n\nComment:\nAbsence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.\n\nPreserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.\n\nE. Multiple deeper levels have been examined. The area of hyperplastic polyp is confirmed and in addition an adjacent area of tubular adenoma with low grade dysplasia has emerged in the deeper levels. The surface resembles hyperplastic polyp, raising the possibility of a combined polyp or sessile serrated adenoma.\nNo evidence of invasive malignancy is identified.\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 45R068901I\nMEDICALRECORD: 4560689\nHOSPITAL: ALBURY WODONGA HEALTH - ALBURY CAMPUS\nDURATION: 6 years=>P6Y\nDATE: April 2066=>2066-04\nDOCTOR: M Tiburcio\nTIME: 15:48 on 3.11.16=>2016-11-03T15:48\nDATE: 6.1.66=>2066-01-06\nDOCTOR: M Swartzlander\nDOCTOR: M Cahee\nDATE: 23/2/2066=>2066-02-23\n"}]}

In some areas the edge of the tumour appears to be encapsulated by a thin rim of lymphoid tissue, consistent with replaced lymph nodes. \nNo glandular or squamous differentiation is seen and no pigment is identified.\nThe tumour shows positive staining for S100 and is negative for HMB45, MelanA, pancytokeratin, CK5/6, AE1/AE3, CK7, ER, PR and SMA.\nFurther markers were assessed, following the initial results above. \nA repeat S100 stain is strongly positive \nCD10 is focally positive. \nRepeat HMB45 remains negative.\nDesmin is negative.

Histology shows a distended appendix with the mucosa replaced by relatively monotonous flattened columnar mucinous epithelium which shows some micropapillary tufting in places.  There is low grade cytological atypia and morphology is consistent with that of a low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm.  Additionally, there are widespread deposits of abundant extracellular mucinous material over the serosal aspect of the appendix and also within the wall which shows fibrosis and loss of the muscularis propria in places.  Scattered within these mucinous pools are occasional strips of low grade atypical mucinous epithelium.  No areas of high grade or frankly malignant invasive adenocarcinoma are seen.  At the proximal end of the appendix adjacent to the resection margin the mucosa appears more normal showing only minor hyperplastic changes with no significant atypia.  \nB.  Histology shows fibrofatty tissue with a littleskeletal muscle.  There are numerous deposits of extracellular mucin with occasional strips of low grade atypical mucinous epithelium consistent with involvement by low grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm.  \nC.

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr M Bready):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr M Penrod who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Miquel comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

The gastric tumour is a 120mm gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). The GIST is adherent to and expands themuscularis propria and has a lobulated appearance. The tumour is variably moderately to highly cellular and is composed of plump to moderately atypical spindled cells arranged in interweaving fascicles with areas of nuclear palisading. In areas, the tumour cells show moderate cytologic atypia, including nuclear enlargement, vesicular chromatin and prominent nucleoli. Foci of myxoid degeneration, haemorrhage and oedema are present throughout the tumour. Mitoses are present, with up to 49 mitoses per 50 high power fields. A focus of possible incipient tumour associated necrosis isseen. The tumour appears clear of the gastric resection margin. Although much of the tumour largely surrounded by a thin rim of fibrous tissue and some attenuated muscularis propria, focally the tumour extends to the inked (serosal) surface. There is no involvement of the overlying gastric submucosa or mucosa, which shows features of a patchy mild non-specific chronic gastritis. \nImmunohistochemical stains were performed and the results are as follows:\nTumour cells positive for:CD117, CD34.\nTumour cells negative for: SMA, Desmin and S100. \nThe Ki-67 immunoproliferative index highlights approximately 15% of tumour cell nuclei. \nC. The specimen shows fragments of organising haemorrhage and fibrous tissue. There is no convincing evidence of tumour.\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe gastric tumour shows morphologic and immunohistochemical features consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Although the behaviour of these tumours can be unpredictable, individual tumours greater than 100mm in size and with a high mitotic rate (greater than 10/50hpf), are typically associated with a high risk of aggressive behaviour (7th edition of the AJCC/TNM). This tumour shows variably prominent moderate nuclear pleomorphism, which is of uncertain clinical significance, as cytologic atypia is not a reliable predictor of tumour behaviour in these tumours. \nDIAGNOSIS:\nA & B.

A synoptic report for breast carcinoma follows:\nInvasive carcinoma:\nSite: Left breast.\nType: Poorly differentiated (smallcell) neuroendocrine carcinoma. \nInvasive tumour size: 30mm (macroscopic).\nThe carcinoma consists of poorly differentiated neuroendocrinecells arranged in infiltrative sheets, trabeculae and cords within fibrosclerotic stroma. Very occasional glands are present within some of the sheetsof tumour cells which may represent focal glandular differentiation. Many of the tumour nests show central necrosis. Focally, the stroma has a hypereosinophilic appearance and congo red staining shows minimal apple green birefringence, possibly representing amyloid. \nGrade (Modified Bloom & Richardson): 3.\nTubules: 3   Nuclei: 3Mitoses: 3     Mitotic rate:      Up to 40/10hpf.\nLymphovascular invasion: Foci highly suspicious for LVI are present.\n\t\nDCIS component:  \nNot identified. \nExcision Margins:  \nInvasive component:\nDeep margin: 2.2mm (C6)\nSuperficial margin: 5.5mm (C8)\nSuperior margin: Clear of tumour (C10)\nInferior margin: Clear of tumour (C9)\nMedial margin: Clear of tumour\nLateral margin: Clear of tumour\nImmunohistochemistry and Hormone Receptors (Block  C1)\nER:  \tNEGATIVE\nPR:\tNEGATIVE   \nHER2 (Novocastra 10A7):  NEGATIVE\nHER SISH:  Performed at Peter Kiewit Sons Central, NORMANTON HOSPITAL Hospital, see separate report.\nKi-67 index: Variable, up to 90% in areas.\nCD56: Positive.\nCK7: Focal positivity.\nCK20, calcitonin and synaptophysin: Negative.\nNipple: No significant histologic abnormality.\n\nLCIS / ALH: Not identified.\nMiscellaneous: The tumour shows focal change consistent with a previous biopsy tract. The adjacent non-neoplastic breast tissue shows fibrocystic change, columnar cell change, apocrine metaplasia and patchy chronic inflammation.\nSentinel lymph node(s):\nSee specimens A and B.\n \n\nCOMMENT:\nThe breast tumour is a poorly differentiated (small cell) neuroendocrine carcinoma. A poorly differentiated adenoid cystic carcinoma and metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma were also considered, but positive staining for the neuroendocrine marker CD56 and negative CK20, respectively, makes these diagnoses unlikely. Although TTF-1 staining is negative, the possibilityof primary lung origin cannot be entirely excluded, and correlation with clinical and radiological findings is essential.\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.  Left axillary (sentinel) node: No evidence of malignancy in five lymph nodes (0/5) (H&E and IHC).\n\nB.  Left breast sentinel node 2: No evidence of malignancy in two lymph nodes (0/2) (H&E and IHC).\n\nC.

The attached fallopian tube is 58mm in length x 5mm in diameter and appears unremarkable with the exception of a 7mm parafimbrial cyst.  A 3 x 3mm yellow nodule is noted on the serosal surface of the soft tissue between the ovary and fallopian tube.  The ovary is sectioned transversely into 9 slices and shows a relatively well circumscribed 19 x 11 x approximately 20mm pale yellow lesion underlying the puckered serosal region (slices 4 to 8).

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr V Yohe):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr V Bognar who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Lucius comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.

However, somatic hyper-methylation or constitutional epimutation of one of these genes can produce a similar phenotype.  Detection of methylation in the promoter region of one of these genes may be useful in determining the heritability of a cancer.\nMethod\nMethylation testing is carried out on DNA extracted from paraffin embedded tumour tissue using a methylation-sensitive multiplex-ligation dependent probeamplification (MS-MLPA) technique.  Methylation-sensitive probes are protected from digestion when bound to the patient's methylated DNA and are subsequently amplified by PCR.  If the patient's DNA is not methylated a product will not beproduced.\nThis method targets methylation sites in the MLH1 promoter corresponding to regions A, B, C and D (Deng et al) and in intron I.  It has been shown that methylation at regions C and D correlates with reduced MLH1 expression, whereas methylation at other sites is non-specific (Capel et al).  The MS-MLPA method provides an estimation of the percentage methylation at each site with a result of greater than 10% considered to be positive.\nReferences\nNCBI reference sequence MLH1: NM_000249.3 \nwww.mrc-holland.com\nDeng G et al.

J Mol Diag 2010;12:498-504.\nResults:\nThe tissue block 11941749 All (Home Depot) and MLPA kit ME011-B2 were used for this analysis.  Methylation of the MLHl gene promoter was detected at the C (53%) and D (51%) region.  This result is consistent with reduced MLH1 expression.  Methylation was also detected at the A (64%) and B (74%) regions and intron 1 (56%).\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "IDNUM: 11Z417493M\nMEDICALRECORD: 1194174.YJM\nPATIENT: ANTWI, SHAWNA JAMIE\nIDNUM: 11Z41749\nIDNUM: 11Z41749\nDEPARTMENT: PaLMS\nCITY: RUTHERGLEN\nSTATE: SA\nZIP: 6372\nDATE: 2/12/2005=>2005-12-02\nTIME: 23/04/2014 at 19:52=>2014-04-23T19:52\nDEPARTMENT: ACUTECARE WARD\nHOSPITAL: MARYBOROUGH DISTRICT HEALTH SERVICE (MARYBOROUGH)\nDOCTOR: EDISON JAGUN WHITTAKER\nDATE: 13.10.64=>2064-10-13\nAGE: 64\nDOCTOR: DQ\nDOCTOR: KR\nDATE: 26.6.64=>2064-06-26\nDOCTOR: D Godwin\nDATE: 1.6.64=>2064-06-01\nDATE: 13.10.64=>2064-10-13\nDEPARTMENT: CPC Pathology\nHOSPITAL: GOONDIWINDI HOSPITAL\nDOCTOR: D Castoreno\nDEPARTMENT: Douglas Hanly Moir\nIDNUM: 11941749\nORGANIZATION: Home Depot\n"}]}

(TO: KM; KM/eh 22/4/2067)\n\n\nMICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Secky):\nA.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show core biopsies of pancreatic tissue.  There is marked acinar atrophy with replacement dense hyaline type fibrosis. There is background retention of a lobular architecture however interspersed amongst the dense fibrous tissue are occasional atypical tubular glands. The glands show  mild to focally moderate nuclear pleomorphism which is difficult to assess in a frozen section sample.  Features often associated with carcinoma in core biopsy samples such as nuclear size variation of 3:1, conspicuous macronucleoli, disrupted glands, perineural invasion, necrosis in lumina are not definitively present, however the glands are atypical and the context of the appearances seen in specimen B likely represent well differentiated adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show a wedge of pancreatic tissue which is partially infiltrated by a well differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows an infiltrative pattern amongst background pancreatic parenchyma which shows variable acinar atrophy.  The glands are tubular with focal secondary lumina and are lined by cells with minimal or mild nuclear pleomorphism and a small to moderate amount eosinophilic cytoplasm.  No morphological evidence of intestinal differentiation such as goblet cells or Paneth cells are seen.  There is associated fibromyxoid desmoplastic stroma and foci of perineural and intraneural invasion are also seen.  No associated extracellular mucin is present.  The sample includes uninvolved pancreatic parenchyma and the ducts here do not show evidence of high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN).  No lymph nodes are identified.  No definite lymphovascular invasion is seen.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nC.  Paraffin sections of the specimen examined at the time of intraoperative frozen section consultation show oedematous fibrovascular cores surfaced by variably ciliated Mullerian type epithelium showing hierarchical branching.  Although some of the papillae appear unsupported they are not four times as high as they are wide.  Nuclear atypia is mild to moderate.  No features of microinvasion are seen. The features are those of a low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.  Sections of ovary show invasive adenocarcinoma.  Differentiation varies with predominantly well to moderate differentiation and a minor poorly differentiated component.  The tumour is composed of tubular and cribriform glandular structures within a moderately cellular oedematous desmoplastic stroma.  In addition to small tubular and cribriform structures the tumour also contains a component of more cystically dilated glands a proportion of which are lined by very bland or mildly atypical simple or stratified columnar mucinous epithelium. Expansile nodular or intracystic papillary growth is not seen.  Some of the cystically dilated areas show higher grade nuclear atypia. Whilst the tumour mainly shows destructive stromal invasion with associated desmoplasia, some area including the cysts are associated with ovarian stroma in a pattern resembling an ovarian mucinous borderline neoplasm  with and without intracystic carcinoma .  The poorly differentiated component comprises minor foci (less than 5%) in which there is either single cell infiltration or signet ring-like differentiation (eg D8, D16, D18).  No associated extracellular mucin deposition to indicate pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  No microscopic surface mucin, or surface deposits are seen. Two small areas of surface disruption are noted.    Occasional glands contain necrotic luminal debris which are predominantly of inflammatory cells with some associated necrotic epithelial cells. Invasive adenocarcinoma involves the fallopian tube with invasion of the wall from the serosal surface (D18, D20) reaching the mucosa at the fimbrial end (D21) .  There is focal endometriosis close to the fallopian tube (D21). The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and no serous tubular carcinoma in-situ is seen.  No benign Brenner component is seen. The ovarian hilum is not identified.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the tumour cells stain as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\n\nE.  Sections of uterus show metastatic adenocarcinoma seenpredominantly surface deposits on the anterior surface (E4).  Adenocarcinoma is also present in the vicinity of the right cornua (E10) and close to the posterior peritoneal reflection (E12).  The carcinoma shows similar morphology to the pancreatic and ovarian disease.   There are also foci of endosalpingiosis (eg E5, E7) as well as endometriosis (E13).  The uterus shows a couple of fibroids (E14, E1) and is otherwise unremarkable. The endometrium is predominantly basal but appears inactive.  The ectocervix and and endocervix are uninvolved and unremarkable.\n\nF.  The right ovary is extensively sampled and the attached fallopian tube including fimbrial end entirely embedded and examined.  Sections of ovary confirm a surface serous low grade borderline tumour associated with psammomatous calcifications as well as multiple deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma shows similar features to that seen in the left ovary and pancreas.  The deposits are seen on the surface of the ovary and also as a single expansile nodule. The expansile nodule shows areas in which the malignant glands are present with  ovarian stroma as well as areas with stromal  desmoplasia. The surface deposits which show similar cytomorphology are present amongst desmoplastic stroma.  The glands show a tubular and cribriform morphology with some poorly differentiated areas with single cell growth (eg F6).  No pseudomyxoma ovarii is seen.  Metastatic moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is also seen within the right ovarian hilum (F11).  Definite lymphovascular invasion is not identified.  Foci of endometriosis are also seen (F11).The right fallopian tube is entirely embedded and examined and is unremarkable and uninvolved.\n\nImmunohistochemistry:\nIn the presence of positive and adequate controls the adenocarcinoma stains as follows:\nPositive:  CK7 (&amp;gt;50%), CK20 (&amp;gt;50%), CK19 and CDX2\nNegative: ER, PR, WT1 and PAX8.\n\nIn contrast to the adenocarcinoma the serous borderline tumour shows typical expression for PAX8, WT1, CK7, ER and PR. CK19 is also positive while CK20 and CDX2 are negative.\n\nG.  Sections of omentum show multiple foci of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar morphology to that seen within the ovaries and pancreas. The carcinoma is composed of small tubular and cribriform glands within a desmoplastic stroma and is seen on the serosal surface associated with mesothelial cell reaction.  Scattered foci of psammomatous calcification are seen both in the vicinity of tumour and separately.  Foci of endosalpingiosis are also seen (G5 and G6). One lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nH.   Sections of peritoneal lined adipose tissue show several deposits of metastatic adenocarcinoma. The carcinoma shows similar morphology to that seen within the pancreas and ovaries. The carcinoma is composed of surface deposits within desmoplastic stroma. The carcinoma appears well to moderately differentiated with well formed tubular or cribriform glands.  One small lymph node shows no evidence of malignancy (0/1).\n\nI &amp;amp; J.  Sections of fibroadipose tissue show a deposit of metastatic adenocarcinoma with similar features to that seen in the other sites.  The carcinoma is well to moderately differentiated.\n\n\nCOMMENT:\nThe adenocarcinoma present with the right ovary, uterus, omentum, peritoneal nodule , right side wall and bladder peritoneal nodule is consistent with metastatic disease with predemoniantly surface deposits.  The morphology  of the adenocarcinoma in the pancreas, in the limited sample, is well differentiated but shows  morphogical features, including perineural invasion, dense hyaline stroma and small tubular glands compatible with pancreatic primary. High grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia is not seen, in the limited sample. The right ovary shows features of (mucinous) adenocarcinoma with varying differentiation (predominantly well to moderate with minor poorly differentiated areas). Areas in the ovarian tumour resemble the pancreatic tumour albeit with some cystic areas and minor poorly differentiated areas in the  more representative ovarian sample.  The presence of bilateral ovarian involvement , extensive intraabdominal disease, destructive stromal reaction in the left ovary and presence of single cells are features that would favour metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to the ovaries in this case. However as the left ovary is very large, has a smooth external surface, lacks expansile nodular growth or surface deposits and shows some areas with bland mucinous epithelium resembling an ovarian borderline mucinous neoplasm, the possibility of synchronous pancreatic and ovarian primaries cannot entirely be excluded.  The presence in the left ovary  of a minor component of relatively bland mucinous tumour is not a helpful discriminator,  as metastatic adenocarcinoma from the pancreas to ovary is a great morphologic mimic of primary ovarian mucinous neoplasm including benign and borderline mucinous neoplasms.   The immunoprofile or the tumour in the pancreas and right and left ovaries (CK7, CK20, CK19 and CDX2 expression) is identical and consistent with intestinal type differentiation.  In the absence of PAX8 expression ( seen in only about 30% of primary ovarian mucinous adenocarcinomas but not in pancreatic primaries)  the immunoprofile is not helpful in determining origin of the disease.  This expression profile could also be seen in other upper gastrointestinal tract primaries.  The immunoprofile, with diffuse CK7 expression argues against appendiceal origin, although examination of the appendix (not received) would be beneficial for completeness.   Selected slides of this case have been seen in consultation with Dr I Debore who favours a pancreatic primary with metastatic intraabdominal disease including to the ovaries. Dr Carlo comments that the morphology in the larger left ovary, with extensive stromal desmoplasia, is more typical of metastatic disease and that intraabdominal metastatic disease from the ovary, including to the pancreas would be exceedingly rare.  Correlation with the disease biology and preoperative imaging features of the pancreatic tumour (eg vascular and nodal involvement) is essential in this case.\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS:\nA.  Pancreatic core biopsy (frozen section):\n-    Atypical mucinous epithelium which in this context is consistent with adenocarcinoma.\n\nB.  Pancreatic biopsy (frozen section):\n-    Adenocarcinoma with perineural invasion (see comment).\n\nC.  Right ovarian lesion (frozen section):\n-    Low grade serous borderline tumour.\n\nD.
